description: The `::: draw` figure language and the graphical diagram editor in psi-slides – the full statement and class vocabulary (box, dot, text, image, edge, container, brace, bars, grid, plot, table, lanes, sequence, step, style, default), the slot tables, the generated names, the three design decisions behind the compiler, and the editor's span-rewriting contract. Use when authoring or debugging a `::: draw` block, when changing `diagram-core.mjs`, the diagram half of `lint.js`, `editor.mjs` or `editor.css`, or when a figure compiles but draws the wrong thing. `figure-design.md` is the craft; this is the machinery.

# The psi-slides figure language and its editor

Lifted out of `CLAUDE.md` so it loads when figures are the work rather than in
every session. The rules below are the compiler's contract: a change to
`diagram-core.mjs` that contradicts one of them is a regression, and every
vocabulary table named here has to change in `lint.js` in the same commit.

## Where the grammar actually is, and it is not this file

**This file is the machinery: the compiler's contract, the slot tables, the
design decisions.** It is written for someone changing `diagram-core.mjs`. It
is not a statement reference, and reading it first to learn how to write a
figure costs an hour. The order that works:

1. **`figure-design.md`** – the craft, with wrong/right pairs in real syntax.
   Its "five arrangements a lecture keeps asking for" is the fastest route to
   a working figure.
2. **`lectures/diagrams/source.md`** – working syntax for `lanes`, `table`,
   `sequence`, `bars`, `grid`, `plot`, steps and tags. Copy from here.
3. **`diagram-core.mjs`'s exported tables**, which are quicker to grep than to
   read about: `DG_KEYWORDS` (the statements), `DG_CLASS_GROUPS` (the slots),
   `DG_KIND_OPTS` (which options each statement takes), `DG_ANCHORS`,
   `DG_STEP_OPS`, `DG_PROMINENCE`, `DG_WORD_OPTS`.
4. **This file**, when something compiles and draws the wrong thing.

## What the compiler is (`::: draw`)

A boxes-and-arrows compiler. The source is a line-oriented DSL inside the lecture markdown, the output is one inline `<svg>` plus, when the author wrote steps, a payload of precomputed per-step geometries the live runtime tweens between. `renderDiagram()` is the entry point; its section of `build.js` is navigable by its own sub-banners between `// ── diagrams (::: draw) ──` and `// ── parsing ──`.

**Development state, not in any tagged release.** The repository and project site may carry `::: draw` as a preview independently of a versioned release; `package.json` still reports 1.0.0, and the latest tag does not include the feature. The changelog entry stays under `## [Unreleased]` – `CONTRIBUTING.md` § Building and releasing bumps the version at release time, not when a preview reaches `main`, so there is nothing to bump here.

**Publishing `main` and cutting a release are separate events.** `pages.yml` fires on every push to `main` and redeploys the project site. It rebuilds and publishes the tutorial – which carries a `#diagram` chunk – and `lectures/diagrams/`, a fourth live demo beside the tutorial, python-intro and the short example. The latter puts every construct of the unreleased format in front of a reader as an explicitly labelled preview. Its four views are also tracked, so they travel in a future release archive and the release workflow rebuilds them to check they match their source.

Before it can ship, in rough order of how much each would hurt to discover late: text width is estimated rather than measured, so a dense layout can be a few percent off; and `::: draw` becomes frozen source-format the moment it is in a tagged release, so **keep the editor marked experimental in the release notes for one minor cycle** if the language ships while the editor is still experimental.

The vocabulary pass that used to head that list has happened: thirty-six rebuilt slides in `lectures/network-security`, then four of the arrangements a lecture keeps asking for – a flowchart, a swimlane, a tree, a table. Three of the four the grammar could already draw; the table it could not draw without naming every cell by hand, and the swimlane only by guessing a band width and re-guessing it whenever the contents changed. `table`, `lanes`, `series of`, `.diamond` and `.elbow` are what came back from it, and each one is a statement or a class that replaced a dozen hand-placed elements rather than a new capability. Treat a further arrangement the same way: build it out of what exists first, and only add a word when the hand-built version is the thing that cannot be maintained.

Three decisions carry the design, and none of them should be traded away casually:

- **No constraint solver.** Positions are expressions over a tiny algebra – a grid cell, an anchor on another element, an offset – so the dependency structure is a DAG resolved by one topological walk. Andrew Myers' [Constrain](https://github.com/andrewcmyers/constrain) is the reference for the other approach (Numeric.js least-squares over `align`/`equal`/`collinear`, rendered to canvas) and it is the right tool for *computed* layouts – tree rotations, sorting animations. It is the wrong tool here on three counts: canvas forfeits theme inheritance, text selection, search and print; a runtime solver is a dependency inside a file that is supposed to be self-contained; and solver failure is non-local – an over-constrained system renders plausibly wrong and reports a residual instead of a line number. `lint.js` can name the line.
- **Layout runs once per step, at build time.** A step is not a transform applied to a finished picture, it is another evaluation of the same layout with different inputs. That is why an arrow stays attached to a box that walks away: the arrow never stored a coordinate, it stored "the right edge of `mix`". `dgStateAt(model, k)` builds the effective state after steps `0..k`; `layoutDiagram` resolves it; `dgFrameDrawables` reduces it to numbers.
- **The runtime interpolates numbers and nothing else.** Every element reduces to one or two drawables, and a drawable is only ever a `rect`, a `circle`, a `path` or a block of `text` carrying a numeric vector. A transition is a lerp between two vectors, applied by setting attributes from `requestAnimationFrame`. This is also why **arrowheads are computed filled paths, not SVG `<marker>`s** – a marker will not rotate with a moving endpoint, and its fill would have to resolve through `context-stroke` to follow the theme.

## The canvas a figure is drawn on

**A slide has a fixed canvas, and a figure is drawn on it.** Every `::: draw`
standing in a chunk's own body gets one, by default, and it is the same
rectangle on every ordinary slide of a deck. That is the whole answer to the
question this section used to spend a page on – how large a figure lands in a
room – and it replaced the arrangement where the viewBox hugged the drawing
and every figure slide therefore settled at its own zoom.

### What the default is

| the chunk | the canvas, in base labels | on a 1600x900 slide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.narrow` | 20.7 × 16 | 655 × 505 px |
| `.standard` | 26.7 × 16 | 842 × 505 px |
| `.wide` | 36.5 × 16 | 1152 × 505 px |
| `.full` | 44.6 × 16 | 1408 × 505 px |

The width is **the chunk's column measured in base labels**, which is exactly
the width at which a base label lands at the size of the words beside it. So
the canvas is not an extra rule on top of the label-size rule – it *is* that
rule, written down as a box. The height is a fixed sixteen label-heights: a
`.wide` chunk with a heading and a sub-heading, two lines of prose under the
drawing and a one-line `::: footnote` costs 383 px of furniture, so such a
slide stands at 888 px in a 900 px frame. That is the fullest a figure chunk
can be, and it fits; eighteen label-heights did not. The ceiling is 17.7, and
it is arithmetic rather than taste – past 62 % of the slide the height cap
takes over and the figure comes out narrower than its own column.

**The height does not come down by the prose under the drawing**, and that was
measured rather than assumed (`docs/history/PLAN-figure-defaults.md` §6 item 7). A shorter
canvas cannot shrink a drawing – the box is the union – so on a slide whose
drawing fills its canvas the trade reaches only a warning; making it bite would
mean scaling each figure by how many words its paragraph runs to, which is the
uneven type the canvas exists to remove, and the build does not know how many
lines a paragraph wraps into. A figure chunk taller than the frame is a
paragraph written for a reader: collapse it, `::: script` it, or give that one
figure a `frame`.

Three details that are not guessable:

- **The em is 31.6 px, not 23.4.** 1rem at 1600x900 is 23.4 px, but a chunk
  body is `1rem × --zoom × --body-scale` and `--zoom` defaults to 1.35. The
  canvas is the column measured in *that*. Reading the rem instead makes every
  canvas a quarter too wide and every label a quarter smaller than the prose
  beside it.
- **The chunk type moves it.** `--body-fs` is 1.2rem on a `principle`, 1.15rem
  on a `question` and 0.9rem on a `figure`, so those chunks' canvases hold
  proportionally fewer or more labels – and the box on the slide comes out the
  same size either way. `FIG_BODY_REM` in build.js is the mirror of those
  rules and `node test/gates/run.mjs canvas` holds the two together.
- **`figure-type` divides both sides.** The key says how large a base label is
  against body type, which is now also how many labels fit in the column:
  `{.figure-type-160}` gives a canvas of 22.8 × 10 labels on a `.wide` chunk,
  the same 1152 × 505 px box with bigger type in it.

### What it does not do

**It changes no drawing's rendered size.** A figure that fits inside its canvas
is drawn at precisely the scale it was drawn at before; only the box round it
grows to the column and the reserve. A figure past it is drawn exactly as it
was too, because the emitted box is the union of the two. What the canvas adds
is a measurable claim – this much slide is a figure's – and therefore two
things the build can say that it could not say before.

**It is the live views' box, not the documents'.** A slide is a fixed frame
and a figure in it is one of a series; a figure in a printed column is
apparatus inside running text, where reserved paper under a small drawing is a
gap. So `print.html` and `print-notes.html` keep the box that hugs the
drawing, and the canvas rides the channel a stepped figure's union box already
rode: `data-live-viewbox` for the attribute the runtime swaps, and
`--dg-live-type-w` / `--dg-live-ar` / `--dg-live-ink-x` beside the print
numbers for the three a stylesheet reads. **Read `--dg-fit-w`, never
`--dg-type-w`, from anything that measures a live view** – `AUDIENCE_CSS`
resolves the fallback chain once on `.psi-diagram`, and `figureCapProbe`,
`--check-fit` and `test/figure-type.mjs` all read the resolved value.

**Which figures get one.** Only a `::: draw` in the chunk's own flow, which is
the only place the chunk's column is the right box. A figure in a card, a
pane, a dock, an overlay or an expansion has a fraction of that column; a
beside-layout divider figure shares the frame with its heading. Those keep
the hugging box. **A cover is the same case and it is the one that is not
obvious**: a `title:` or `closing:` chunk's body is not in a text column at
all – `cover: beside` and `cover: above` hand it to the art panel that
`cover-ratio` divides the frame with, `masthead` and `quote` set it as a
field beside the title pair – so a cover figure keeps the hugging box too.
(Before that it was given a `.standard` column sixteen labels tall, and
`lectures/python-intro`, whose four stacked boxes stand comfortably in a 34%
panel running the height of the slide, was warned `figure-overflows-canvas`
and had to write `frame none`.) **A stacked divider (`# Heading {.stack}`) is the one
divider with a column**, the `.full` measure, so its figure is on a canvas
too – `.full` wide and 20 labels tall, the 0.72 of the slide its own rule
allows – and a keynote that opens each part on a figure gets the same type
there as on every chunk. Measured before that: four stacked dividers of one
talk settled 26% under the deck. `::: slide` and `::: script` are not layout – they say
which half of the chunk is the screen – so a figure inside one still gets a
canvas.

### The two warnings

Both are one line per figure, sited like every other `[diagram]` warning, and
neither fails a build.

- **`figure-overflows-canvas`** – the drawing is wider or taller than its box.
  The message gives both sizes in labels, the overshoot per axis **in labels
  and in px**, the body
  type the slide will settle at against the one every figure that fits gets,
  and a `frame WxH` that would reserve what this drawing actually draws. A
  figure whose own labels also land under 18 px says so in the same line
  rather than earning a second one.
- **`figure-underfills-canvas`** – the drawing uses less than half the
  canvas's area, so the slide reads empty and, on a text-heavy chunk, auto-fit
  takes the prose down to make room for paper. The message gives the share,
  both sizes, how many labels a narrower column would hold, and the same
  `frame WxH`.

**A figure on one axis is reported in labels and in px, in both reports.** The
overshoot is decided at half a pixel, so a label figure to one decimal – a
base label is `DG_FONT` px – covered a range of seven px, and "over by 0.2
across" was anything from 2.3 px to 3.7 px: an author shortening a label
against it built three times to find out which. The static complaint and
`--check-fit`'s per-figure room line both spell `<labels> <axis> (<px> px)`
now. They cannot share a helper – one is emitted at the end of the parse, the
other measured in a browser – so `test/gates/canvas.mjs` holds the two shapes
against each other as text, beside the three numbers it already mirrors.

**Neither is mirrored in `lint.js`, and neither can be**: both need the
drawing laid out, which needs the compiler, which is the whole thing the
linter is kept independent of. `figure-type-small` survives beside them for a
figure with **no** canvas – under `frame: none`, or in a card, a pane, a
divider or a cover – where nothing else can say that a deck's figures are
uniformly unreadable. `figure-type-uneven` is gone: its whole content was "this slide's
type is out of step with the deck's", which a figure inside its canvas cannot
be and a figure past it is told in plainer words.

`--check-fit` reports the same thing from the other end, measured rather than
computed: the canvas fill per figure, every figure that had to be scaled past
its canvas, and the deck's settled body type with the slides its figures took
down.

### `frame`

```
::: draw 150x56 frame 6x4          this figure's canvas, in grid units
::: draw frame none                this figure keeps the box that hugs it
```

```yaml
draw-defaults: |
  frame 6x4                        every figure in the deck
  frame none                       no figure in the deck gets a canvas
  default text {.small}
```

`WxH` is counted in the figure's own grid units – the cells `::: draw 150x56`
sets – so `frame 6x4` is six cells across and four down. Decimals are allowed
where the grid's are not: a grid is the size of one cell in whole pixels, a
frame is a count of cells, and half a row is a thing an author can want. Both
sides positive, at most 200.

The opener's order is strict and the frame comes between the grid and
playback: `::: draw [WxH] [frame WxH|none] [autoplay N [cycle]]`. It is read
by `parseDrawOpener` in `tails.mjs` like the rest of the line, refused under
`bad-frame` (not a `WxH`, a zero or oversized side, the word missing) and
`stray-attribute` (written twice, or after `autoplay`), and it rides in the
figure's payload as part of the formatted opener – so the editor writes it
back verbatim, exactly as it does `autoplay`.

**`frame: none` is for a deck that is a catalogue rather than a talk**, and
the two in this repository are the test of that: `lectures/diagrams` and
`docs/artifact/figure-rules` are both sets of specimens standing on slides of
prose that explain them, and reserving a talk's figure box for each of them
put half a slide of paper under a two-box drawing – and, on eleven of the
diagrams lecture's slides, took the prose down to make room for it. A deck
whose figures are slides wants the default.

### The editor draws it

A dashed rectangle in the guide layer, behind the drawing, wherever the figure
has a canvas. It is the one thing about a figure that is decided outside the
block, and without it the only way to learn a drawing had outgrown its slide
was to build and read a warning. Where it sits inside the viewBox follows the
compiler's own two lines: the content is anchored at the canvas's top, and to
its left edge under `blocks: left` or centred on it under `center`. When the
drawing fits, the dashes lie on the edge of the box; when it does not, they
run through the picture, which is exactly the thing worth seeing.

## The opener: `::: draw [WxH] [frame WxH|none] [autoplay N [cycle]]`

```
::: draw                                  default grid
::: draw 150x56                           the grid, in units
::: draw 150x56 frame 6x4                 …and the canvas it is drawn on
::: draw 150x56 frame none                …or no canvas at all
::: draw 150x56 autoplay 1200             walks its own steps, one delay per beat
::: draw 150x56 autoplay 1200 cycle       and starts again at the end
```

**No braces.** Everywhere else in the format a `{…}` tail holds sigil tokens – `.word`, `#word`, and inside a draw body `@word` and `!word` – and a line that has no sigil tokens to carry has no braces. The draw opener carries values, so it is written the way `::: side 2:1` is: the one primary argument positional, everything optional that carries a value a keyword after it. The old braced form (`unit=` and `autoplay=` keys inside `{…}`) is refused with the new spelling of that very line in the message (`stray-attribute`); `tools/migrate-draw-opener.mjs` rewrites a whole repository. There is no `#id` on the opener any more – it was stored and used for nothing but the compiler's error prefix, and that prefix now names the chunk (`in chunk #cbc`) or, for a divider figure, the column (`in the divider of column #part-2`).

**One parser, four callers.** `parseDrawOpener(line)` in `tails.mjs` answers `null` for a line that is not a draw opener, a `{unit, frame, autoplay, cycle, problems: []}` for a good one, and the same shape with `problems` for one that begins `::: draw` and must be refused – `stray-attribute` (the braced form, `autoplay=`, an unknown or out-of-order word), `bad-unit` (`150X56`, a zero side), `bad-frame` (not a `WxH` in grid units, a zero or oversized side, the word with nothing after it), `bad-autoplay` (not a number, outside 200–60000 ms, or `cycle` with nothing to repeat). build.js (both the chunk and the column-heading site), lint.js and `test/gates/corpus.mjs` all call it, so none keeps a pre-regex of its own. A refused opener is still an opener: lint captures the body through the closing `:::` and reports the one problem rather than a cascade of Markdown errors.

**The compiler sees the grid and nothing else.** `drawCompilerAttrs()` turns the parsed opener into the `unit=` head-attribute string `parseDiagramSource` always took, and the compiler now *refuses* `autoplay=` or a `#id` there as an unknown option – there is no `DG_HOST_OPTS` skip list any more, because no caller hands it a host word. Playback is not part of the drawing: the compiler's job ends at a set of per-beat geometries, and `diagram-core.mjs` also runs inside the browser editor, where there is no deck to play. `withAutoplay()` in build.js puts the delay on the emitted `<figure>` as `data-autoplay`.

**The payload carries the whole opener, formatted.** `renderDiagram` serialises `opener: opts.opener` – the line `formatDrawOpener()` produced – next to the compiler-only `attrs`, and the editor's `dgeBlockText()` writes `DGE.fig.opener + body + ':::'`. That is what fixed the clipboard tier, which used to rebuild the opener from `attrs` and so dropped `autoplay` and `cycle` on every copy. The editor copies the line; it cannot import the formatter, because `editor.mjs` is inlined as a classic script.

## `autoplay N cycle`

A figure written `autoplay 1200` walks its own steps on a timer once the slide is on screen, one delay for every step. A cover figure that animates while the audience files in is the case it was asked for; it works on any chunk because nothing about it is cover-specific.

Two decisions carry the runtime, and both are about not inventing state:

- **It calls `advanceReveal()`, so it is the Space key on a timer.** A private step index would have let the drawing and the reveal counter disagree, and the next Space would jump. Because it *is* the counter, the speaker view follows through the ordinary state broadcast, the freeze gate applies, and localStorage recovery is unchanged.
- **It runs in the audience only** – the state root – **and the first key, pointer or wheel event on that slide retires its clock.** Two windows both advancing would take two beats per tick; and a lecturer who has touched the deck has taken over, so a timer resuming underneath them is worse than no timer. Verified in a browser: interrupted one beat in, the figure froze there and stayed frozen for three seconds, and a manual Space then advanced it by exactly one.

It also refuses to start from a half-revealed slide: arriving at one means the lecturer left it that way, and finishing it for them is the surprise this must not spring. Bounded 200 ms – 60 s, **refused rather than clamped**, because a clamped number is a number the author did not write.

**`cycle` repeats the walk**, which is what a cover figure usually wants while the audience is arriving. It rewinds by writing `revealed[id] = 1` through the same counter everything else reads, so the speaker view follows the rewind exactly as it followed the walk. The last beat is held for one delay like any other – **a second number for "how long to admire the finished picture" is a knob nobody asked for and one more thing to get wrong.** A bare `cycle`, read off the opener by the same `parseDrawOpener` and never handed to the compiler; `cycle` with no `autoplay` is `bad-autoplay` in both the build and `lint.js`, because there is nothing for it to repeat.

## Seven placement traps, six of them the compiler warns about

Every one of these produced a clean build, a clean lint and a broken figure,
and they are the reason `dgOverlapWarnings`, `dgLabelGroundWarnings`,
`dgLabelClipWarnings`, `dgEdgeShortWarnings` and `dgElbowRailWarnings` exist.
The fifth, a free `.left` text, is here because it was one of them: it had a
warning in each file and now has neither, because the default changed under
it.

**Place a row of elements relationally, never with absolute `at`.** Two boxes
written `at swim.left+5.4 w 1.45` and `at swim.left+6.75 w 1.4` have centres
1.35 apart and half-widths summing to 1.425, so they overlap by 0.075 units and
the arrow between them has nowhere to be drawn. Written `right of marks gap 0.3`
the arithmetic cannot drift when a label changes. The same trap in the
vertical: **a stacked column's row pitch has to exceed the box height, and the
box height comes from the label** – on a `112x40` grid a two-line box is 55 px
tall, so a pitch of 0.85 units (34 px) overlaps every pair, plausibly enough to
read as a design choice.

**The census compares ink, and a `text` is compared line by line.** A label's
box is the block of line boxes: `DG_LINE_H` tall per line where only
`DG_INK_H` of that is glyphs, and as wide as its *widest* line. Neither of
those is what a reader sees, and both cost the check a real defect. It
answered the first with a 24 px floor wherever either side was a text – more
than a whole line of figure type, on a drawing that is then scaled up to its
canvas – and the geometry it exists for, an outline drawn through the words,
crosses that outline by a fraction of one line by construction:
`lectures/network-security` `#ns-a41` shipped a three-line verification block
printed across the box above it, at 5.5 px, with a silent build. So a text is
now the rectangles it actually inks, one per line (`dgTextInkRects`), and
everything meets at one 2 px tolerance. Two consequences to know before
arguing with a warning. **A label whose long line is nowhere near a shape is
not touching it** – the two-line value `Basic Constraints ( 2.5.29.19 ) / YES`
beside a chevron is 186 px on one line and 22 on the other, and only the short
one is anywhere near. And **a text fully inside a box is exempt while a text
crossing its edge is not**, so shrinking a figure can make captions that were
inside start reporting: that is the check working, and the fix is the drawing.
**The number is said in rows** – `overlap by 5.38×0.06 rows (215×3 px of the
drawing's own grid …)` – because a `gap` is measured in rows on both axes, so
the figure is the one that goes on the line the message tells you to write.
The px beside it are the compiler's, not the room's: the slide scales a
drawing to fill its canvas and the compiler cannot know by how much.

**`right of X gap N` is checked against X and against nothing else.** An
annotation placed `right of vu gap 2.6` landed inside the box to vu's right and
printed across its label. Relational placement has to clear every neighbour,
not just its anchor.

**A `.paper` label's ground is as wide as the words, and it is drawn over the
stroke.** On a short edge it covers the whole line: the connector disappears
and the words float in the gap. What matters is the **exposed** line – an
elbow's outer runs lie under the boxes at either end, so a ground covering 18 %
of the path can cover 100 % of what a reader can see. On a straight link
between two facing boxes the knock-out is the right form and the flowchart in
`lectures/diagrams` uses it deliberately; on an elbow the route is the
information and erasing it erases which box joins which.

**And that is why the ground on a straight run stays opt-in, although a plan
asked for it as the default.** `docs/history/PLAN-figure-defaults.md` §2.5 proposed giving
every labelled straight edge the knock-out, and it was written when an
ungrounded label sat *on* its own line with the stroke through the words – at
which point the ground was the only fix there was. Two rules have landed since
and between them they answer both halves without breaking a connector. **A
label with no fill is carried clear of the line** (the `side` offset), so a
straight run is one unbroken arrow with its word above it. **A label its own
route crosses somewhere else gets `dg-halo`**, which knocks out the glyph
shapes and nothing else, so a curve, a doubled-back `via` and an elbow's outer
run are covered where a rect would erase the arc the label belongs to. What the
proposed default would have done instead is measured: two boxes a written
`gap 1.1` apart on a `120x72` grid leave 79.2 px of paper between their faces,
and the ground behind `sends` is 66.5 px – 84 % of everything a reader can see,
leaving two stubs of about six pixels and an arrowhead with nothing behind it.
That is the trap in the paragraph above, and it would have become the rule for
every labelled straight edge in the corpus: twelve in `lectures/diagrams`,
fifteen in the tutorial, thirteen in `docs/artifact/figure-rules`. The keynote
the plan was written against has **no labelled edge at all**, so it could not
have shown it. `{.paper}` remains the way to ask for the knock-out where the
run is long enough to carry it, and `.clear` is the `none` the plan asked the
ground slot to gain – it is already in the fill slot and already displaces a
`.paper` arriving from a `default edge` layer.

**A label between two boxes has only the paper between their near faces, and a
box is painted after the edge under it.** On a `126x38` grid two boxes at
`gap 1.05` leave 40 px of clear paper; `encrypted` measures 71, so 31 px of the
word went under the boxes and the audience read `crypte`. The tutorial shipped it.
`dgLabelClipWarnings` states both numbers, because the fix is a number.

Three things it deliberately does **not** report, and each is a figure the
corpus already contains. It compares **both** axes: `side top` lifts the words
off the line, and where the elements at either end are short enough to pass
under them the width constrains nothing, so a width test alone would call a
correct figure broken. It compares the **ink** and not the line box, because a
measured label carries the font's leading (`DG_LINE_H - 1` of the type size)
above and below its glyphs and that air is not overlap. And it compares only
the edge's **own two ends** – a third shape the label crosses belongs to
`dgOverlapWarnings` and has a different fix, and this is also what keeps every
`sequence` out of it, since a message's endpoints are coordinates on two
lifelines rather than element references. An `.elbow` needs no special case:
its label sits on the rail, out in the gap and clear of both ends,
which is the same distinction between the drawn run and the exposed one that
the ground check above is built on. A `.front` edge is exempt outright.

**A free `text` written `.left` used to be centred on its point like every
other one, so the edge the class names was half a label width from the
coordinate the author aimed at.** That is the one trap on this list that is
gone rather than reported: `.left` on a free `text` at an **absolute**
placement now anchors it on that edge, and `.right` on its right
(`dgPlaceAnchor`). `text l "zu Hause" at haus.left+0.2,haus.top+0.35 {.left}`
means what it reads as – 0.2 in from the frame, first letter on the line –
where before it put half the words outside the box it names, and on a one-line
label the class moved nothing at all, which is what made it invisible.

Four bounds, and each is a figure the corpus contains. It is a **free text**
only: on a `box` or a `dot` the class ranges the label inside an outline that
has its own position, which is a different question with the same word. It is
an **absolute** placement only – a relative one states a face of another
element and answers this with `flush`, which already puts the ink on the edge.
A written `anchor` wins whatever it says, and **`anchor center` is how the old
centring is spelled out** – which is why `anchor center` is now *recorded*
where it used to be dropped as the default: it is the word that says "not
that", and a word that says something cannot be dropped. (`dgPlaceAnchor` still
answers `null` for the centre, so it costs no offset and the editor keeps
offering guides on such an element.) And a `.turn`ed label is centred whichever
way it reads, the same answer `dgLabelAnchor` gives it.

**The same sentence now covers the placement and not only the class, and the
day it did not cost a keynote a jumping caption.** A free text is as wide as
its glyph run, so *every* way of placing one puts a named side of it on a
coordinate: `anchor tl` its left edge, `right of x gap n` its left edge, `left
of x` its right, `flush left` / `flush right` the side they name, `align x
left` the same, and a bare `at` or a `between` its centre. `layoutDiagram`
records which of those it was as `pinX` on the box, and `labelBox` draws the
words from that edge – `text-anchor: start` at `box.x`, `end` at `box.x +
box.w` – instead of centring them on the box's middle. The reason is that the
middle is an **estimate**: the error between `dgMeasure` and what the browser
sets is split in two and half of it lands on the side the author pinned, so a
`label` step swapping in a longer string changes that half and the words move
sideways although nothing in the source moved them. Measured on a keynote's
zone caption, `im Raum` relabelled to `im Raum · 3 Stunden, ohne Internet`:
11 px to the right, on a caption whose whole point is that it sits in the
corner of its area.

**In estimate space the change moves nothing at all**, which is what makes it
safe: the origin goes from `box.x + box.w / 2` drawn `middle` to `box.x` drawn
`start`, `extentsOf` answers the anchor question through the same
`labelAnchor` map, and the reserved box, the viewBox and every placement
warning are the bytes they were. Only which end of the *real* glyph run
absorbs the difference changes. Three bounds: a **free text** only, because on
a box or a dot the words are centred inside an outline that has its own
position and moves with the same estimate; a text **sized by its own label**
only, because an explicit `w` makes "as far left as the box allows" the
different sentence `.left` says; and never over a written `.left` / `.right`,
which is the author's own answer, nor over `.turn`, which is centred whichever
way it reads. That last bound is why **`turn` is in `DG_STEP_FIXED`**: the
class now decides, once, between the pinned edge and that centring, so a
`style` step cannot carry it. Before the pin the two answers were the same
word, nothing was baked, and it was not in the table.

`align x left a, b, c` is not retired with the warnings: it holds a *set* to
one edge and is still what three labels at three different coordinates want.
What it no longer has to do is repair a row that shares one coordinate.

**Two warnings existed for nothing but this trap and both are gone**, which is
the test of the change: `dgLabelAnchorWarnings` here, which measured a label's
ink against the element its `at` x named, and `diagram-ragged-labels` in
`lint.js`, which found the same thing from the source and needed two or more
labels at one x to see it. Neither geometry can arise now. The corpus cost of
flipping it, read frame by frame: 18 free texts in `lectures/network-security`,
2 in `lectures/diagrams`, 2 in `lectures/python-intro`, none in the tutorial,
the decoration deck or `docs/artifact/figure-rules`. Of the 18, six are the
first element of their block and everything else hangs off them, so the drawing
is unmoved and only the viewBox shifts; four are repairs the author had written
by hand and not got (`"Client"` and `"Server"` now sit on the two edges of the
arrow column they name; four `.right` labels at `X.left+0.2` now end short of
the staircase at `X.left+0.35` instead of crossing it); six move and read as
well or better; and two – the paragraph pair in `#ns-a30` – relied on the old
centring and were moved half their own width left, which is the repair the rule
asks for rather than an escape from it.

**An arrow the room can see the head of and not the shaft.** The default gap
clears one, but a *written* `gap` is the author's number and is never widened
for them: other elements are chained off it, so moving it moves them. The other
half of the rule is that the author hears about it. `dgEdgeShortWarnings`
measures the **exposed** run – the part of the route not under either of the
edge's own endpoints, because a box is painted after the edge beneath it –
against `DG_EDGE_MIN`, 1.5 labels or 28 px, which sits just under the joined
default so the default itself never trips it. Measured on `dgEdgeRoute` rather
than on the emitted stroke, because the stroke has already been trimmed back by
most of an arrowhead and the question is how much paper the head and the shaft
have to share. It names both ends, the run in px and in labels, and the number
of rows that would clear it.

**On an `.elbow` the run it measures is the arrival run** – the segment after
the rail – rather than the whole exposed route, because an elbow's exposed
route is mostly rail and the rail is shared between every edge that turns on
it. `dgEdgeRoute` already slides the rail toward the source to buy that run
`DG_ELBOW_ARRIVE`, so the warning fires only where the gap cannot pay for it
and a head's length out as well – a span under `DG_ELBOW_ARRIVE +
DG_ELBOW_LEAVE`, 36.75 px – and it names the two fixes there: more gap, or
`via`. The `.elbow` entry in the slot vocabulary below says how the rail
slides.

Two exemptions, and both are the rule rather than exceptions to it. **A
headless edge** – `--`, which is what a leader stub is, or anything carrying
`.no-head` – has no head to crowd, and a short plain connector reads as a tick
joining two things, which is what a leader is for: the tutorial's own
`text note "…" below px gap 0.5 -- px` leaves exactly 28 px and is correct, and
a tree written `--` is the same case on an elbow – `docs/artifact/figure-rules`
`#tree` is six of them at spans the floor would otherwise report. **A
synthesised edge** – a `sequence` message, a chart's baseline – is placed by the
statement that made it, and the fix this warning names is not a line the author
has; there the number to change is that statement's own `space`. Over the
corpus: five figures, every one of them a written gap of 0.3 to 0.55 rows on a
grid where that is 20 to 27 px, and all five were repaired by taking the written
gap off the line.

**An `.elbow`'s rail lying on the side of a box it has nothing to do with.**
The rail is halfway between the two faces on whichever axis the ends are
further apart, and the class looks at nothing else in the figure – that bound
is what keeps it a class rather than a router, and it does not change here.
What changes is that the author hears about it. In a row written `gap 0` the
halfway point is the *seam* between two boxes, so every elbow passing that row
drew its rail exactly on an outline: the lines read as if they ran inside the
boxes, and the arrows arrived at the target in one bundle with nothing to say
which came from where. `dgElbowRailWarnings` reports a vertical rail within a
quarter of a row of a box's side, names the edge, the box and both fixes – a
`gap` in the row, or `via` to write the route by hand.

**The edge's own two ends are exempt, and that exemption is the rule rather
than an exception to it.** The rail is halfway between their facing sides, so
on any pair closer than half a row it is within a quarter of one by
arithmetic – which is exactly the bracket `.elbow` was built to draw, and the
reason it measures from the faces at all: two connectors leaving one parent
land their rails on one line and the drawing reads as one bracket. Run over
the corpus without the exemption it reported five figures, every one of them a
tree bracket or a swimlane hand-off doing its job. What is left is the case
that is never intentional.

**Every `[diagram]` warning that names an element says where that element was
written, and an edge says what it joins** – `dgSite(el)`, which composes
`dgWhere` (`line N of the block`, the same number the error gate prints) and,
for an edge, `dgEdgeEnds` (`a -> b`). The reason is that half the names in this
grammar are generated: `edge-4`, `t-1-2`, `wa-3`, `f-0`, `swim-cap-1` are
positional, none of them is in the source, and the one move a reader has –
search the block for the name the message used – finds nothing. Measured on a
real keynote: `edge edge-4 runs 0.5° off the axis` against fourteen figures and
about thirty edges, not one of them named. Two things carry it: every statement
records its own `line`, and the `edge` statement records the two endpoint
**tokens** as written (`ends`) plus the arrow, normalised so a leftward token
is not printed beside the ends the model has already swapped. A generated edge
sets `ends` where the names exist – a `sequence` message names its two actors,
a leader stub its text and its subject – and otherwise falls back to the refs,
because `a point -> a point` names nothing at all.

## Peers share one size, and a box is never too small for its words

**A run of `right of` / `left of` boxes shares one width and one height, and
nothing in the source says so.** That is the default, and it is the one default
in this grammar that moves an existing drawing. The reason is `figure-design.md`
rule 11: relative size reads as importance, and the usual reason one box in a
row is wider is that its label happened to have more letters. The exception – a
box that really is bigger – is what should cost a word, and it does.

**A chain, precisely.** Boxes reachable from each other through
`DG_CHAIN_DIRS` – `right of`, `left of`, `below`, `above` – or named together by
a `row` / `col` statement. `between` and `at` are deliberately not chain links:
they are coordinates, not adjacency, and three boxes hung off three different
zones are not a row. Only `box` chains; a `dot`, a `text` and an `image` are
sized by what they draw.

**Two things that are asked about and are deliberately not chains.** A
**`zone`'s children** are not, and that survived `in z` becoming a real
membership relation: what an area holds is a *set*, not a run, and three boxes
standing in one area are no more peers than three hung off one coordinate.
`row` / `col` is still the statement that says which of them are peers – and
`row a, b, c in z` is how the two are said in one line. A **`table`'s cells** are not
either, because they do not need to be: a table row is one height by
construction, and the rule the chain would have given it is the row-height rule
below – the row is as tall as its tallest cell's label. Neither is a `zone`
itself, nor a `table`, `lanes`, `bars`, `grid`, `plot` or `sequence` frame: all
of them draw a box and none of them is one, so `synth` – the flag that already
keeps them out of the overlap census – keeps them out of chains, and a note
placed `right of` a five-column table does not come out five columns wide.

**Neither `row` nor `col` carries a `{…}` tail**, so neither adds a slot table
to `tails.mjs`: like `align` and `spread` they take a member list and, in their
case, one keyword with a value.

**Three families, never merged into one, and each axis asks a different one.**

| link | shares width | shares height | measured over |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `right of` / `left of` | yes | yes | natural sizes |
| `below` / `above` | yes | **no** | natural sizes |
| `row a, b, c` | yes | yes | what the two above settled |
| `col a, b, c` | yes | yes | what the two above settled |

The asymmetry on the second row is what the corpus taught, and it is not a
hedge. `lectures/network-security#ns-a45` is a certificate: seven fields, then
two, then one, then one, stacked with `gap 0`. Giving every band the tallest
one's height turns a record into four equal blocks that say nothing. A band's
height is what stands in it; its width is the record's. `col` is how a column
of real peers says so in one line, and that is the whole reason the statement
exists beside `row`.

**Nor do the families merge.** A box in a row *and* a column takes the larger of
what each asks for, but its neighbours in the row are not asked to match the
column. Merging them made `lectures/diagrams#alignment`, whose two rows are
joined by a single `below`, one block of eight boxes all as wide as the widest
label in either row. Every implicit maximum is taken over the members'
**natural** sizes, so nothing compounds and the order the two resolve in changes
nothing.

**`row` / `col` are the exception, and that is what they are worth writing
for.** A statement resolves **last** and over whatever the two implicit
families settled, so it levels its members against everything else they stand
in – which is the one case the implicit rule cannot reach on its own. In
`lectures/decoration#bare-loop` `Site` stands in a row with `Crawler` and in a
column with `Scoring service`, so it comes out wider than its own row: `row
crawler, site` is the line that makes the row level, and `same w as` is the
answer for one box rather than a set.

**A member is measured over every label a `label` step will ever give it**
(`dgLabelVariants`), so the four-line variant is what beat 0 reserved room for.
A box whose size grows mid-figure moves everything placed against it; a box
whose size was settled for its longest label moves nothing.

**Four ways an axis stops being the chain's**, and they are all the same
sentence – somebody already said what this size is:

- a `w` / `h` on the element's **own line**. It is that member's own **and** the
  chain's maximum, so `box a "…" w 1.5` at the head of a row does what
  `same as a` on the rest used to do, without the words. A `default` layer's
  size is not one of these – see below.
- `same as X`, which still wins outright – and, like `.own`, ends the run:
  nothing reaches through it.
- `same w as X` / `same h as X`, one axis each. A copied axis is not evidence
  about how wide the chain has to be, so it contributes nothing to the maximum.
- `{.own}`, the word for a box that is not one of its neighbours. It also
  **breaks** the chain, which is how a run meant as two rows is written as two.
  A `.turn` box is exempt without saying so: a label read bottom-to-top is what
  an author writes when the element is a bar – a firewall, a matrix row, an axis
  – so it is narrow by declaration, and sizing it to the box beside it undoes
  the reason the class was written.

`.own` is in `DG_STEP_FIXED`: which boxes share a size is read off the
placements once, before any beat is drawn, and a beat that took a box out of
its chain would resize the whole row under it.

**A size from a `default` layer is a floor, and a floor is neither a pin nor
evidence.** `default box w 10.4 h 2.5` says what the boxes in this block are
*unless something says otherwise*, and a chain is one of the things that say
otherwise, so the two directions come out like this:

- **a peer needs more, and everyone in the chain gets it.** `box a … h 4.8`
  beside `box b … right of a` under that layer makes both 4.8 – the number is
  written once, on the line that has a reason for it. `row a, b` does the same
  where the two are not placed against each other. Before this, the layer
  counted as a written size on every box, no chain sizing reached a figure that
  opened with one, and a keynote's build plan carried the same `h` on both
  cells of every row for want of any way to level the second against the first.
- **the chain needs less, and the floor stands.** A run of short labels under
  `default box w 3` comes out three units wide, not label-wide: the layer
  already answered, and the chain's maximum is only ever an *increase*.

A box the layer sized asks the chain for nothing, which is the same rule read
from the other end: what a member contributes to the maximum is what it *needs*
– its label, or a number on its own line – never the floor it was handed. That
is why `lectures/diagrams#cbc` still draws: `default box @dec w 0.48` under
`default box w 0.82` makes the Dec boxes narrower than the ciphertext boxes
they hang under, and a floor that counted as evidence would put 0.82 on all of
them. A layer that sizes some of the boxes is a statement that those boxes
differ, so the row it leaves ragged is the author's own – and `{.own}` in a
`default` layer still switches chaining off altogether, which is what
`lectures/diagrams#alignment` is written on.

**An own-line number still beats the layer**, both ways round: `w 0.6` under
`default box w 3` is 0.6, and it is the chain's evidence at 0.6 rather than at
3. The overflow warnings read the size the box comes out at, floor and chain
resolved, so a box that grew with its neighbours is not warned about and one
that did not is warned about the width it really got.

**`row` / `col` stand beside `align` and `spread`**, not beside `box`: they draw
nothing and only name elements that already exist. `row a, b, c gap 0.8` is one
size and one gap on one line. Every member that states **no placement of its
own** is placed after the one before it with that gap – so the "has no
placement" complaint is deferred to the end of the block in both the build and
`lint.js`, because the statement may be written before or after the boxes it
names. A member that *is* placed keeps its placement and the row sizes it only,
which is the three-boxes-against-three-zones case; and a row's `gap` still fills
in a relative placement against the previous member that states none, so "one
gap" holds whichever way the run was written. A placement a `row` wrote carries
`implicit`, the word the first element's origin carries, because there is
nothing on that element's line for an editor to rewrite.

**`same h as` / `same w as`** are what `same as` could not say: a one-line box
beside a two-line one wants the neighbour's height and its own width. They are
also the only way to give a **`zone`** one of its two numbers – a zone is fixed
size on purpose, but "fixed" and "written here" are two different claims.
`same as` together with either half is refused: one size said twice.

**Two warnings for a written size that cannot hold its own words.** A written
`w` under its label has warned since `w` existed; a written `h` did not, so a
two-line label in a one-line box ran over the outline in silence – measured on a
keynote's `#drei-orte`, which shipped with the text inside the padding and zero
warnings. Both are measured against the **ink** the lines make (`DG_INK_H`,
0.93 em: cap height plus descender) rather than against their line boxes,
because a label is centred in its box and its leading may hang over the outline
without a reader seeing anything. A **written table `row`** is held to the same
number, and an automatic one is `DG_ROW_H` scaled by the type size **and by the
tallest cell's line count** – so a two-line cell makes its own room and a
single-line table anywhere in the corpus is byte-identical to before.

**The editor is told what the compiler decided.** Each laid-out box carries
`chainW` / `chainH`, and `dgeResizeEdits` uses them for the callout: a drag that
writes a `w` on one member of a row pins *that* box and lets the rest re-settle,
so making the dragged box the narrowest visibly moves boxes nobody touched. The
look panel's `size` row is the `.own` control. Nothing in the drawing reads
either flag.

**Not mirrored in `lint.js`, and cannot be:** which boxes are peers and how wide
each comes out both need the figure laid out. What lint does mirror is the
grammar – `row` / `col` and their two refusals, the three `same … as` forms and
their references, the zone's relaxed requirement, and the deferred
no-placement complaint. `test/gates/chains.mjs` holds the two files side by
side.

## The vocabulary, and the rule behind each word

**The additions to the drawing vocabulary are all one idea: draw the same numeric vector a different way, or expand at parse time into elements that already exist.** That is what keeps the three decisions under *What the compiler is* intact – extents, the viewBox, the dependency walk and the tween never learned that any of it exists. The list has outgrown counting; what has not changed is that nothing on it introduced an element kind, a drawable or a runtime concept.

- **A bare `.cross` box is square**, squared in `sizeOf` rather than in `dgShapeD`: the footprint the layout reserves has to be the footprint that is drawn, so making the path square while the box stayed 66 by 37 would put the extents somewhere the drawing is not. A plus with arms of two different lengths is not a plus; left to the general rule it came out at the minimum width against one line of type. An explicit `w` is still the author's.
- **Outline classes on `box`** – `.hex`, `.diamond`, `.chevron`, `.wedge`, `.cross`, sharing the slot `.round` and `.sharp` already occupied, because a hexagon has no corner radius to argue about. **`.diamond` is the one outline that eats both axes**, and in proportion to the label rather than to the other axis: the widest room a diamond offers is a strip w/2 by h/2 through its centre, so a label that fits a rect `lw` by `lh` needs a diamond `2lw` by `2lh`. That is why `dgShapeInsetX` takes the label width and the horizontal padding as two optional extra arguments – every other shape answers from the cross-axis alone and ignores them, so every existing caller is unchanged. It has no point, so `point` on it is the same error `point` on a hexagon is. **Which way a pointed outline aims is the `point` option** (`up` / `down` / `left` / `right`), not a class: a chevron aimed up is the same shape aimed differently, and a class per shape per direction would quadruple a list that is meant to stay closed. The direction rides on the drawable kind as `chevron:up`, so the geometry vector is still the rect's four numbers – rotating the finished points would have turned a w-by-h box into an h-by-w one and moved the footprint the layout computed. `point` on an outline with no point, or on none, is an error, and **`point` lives in `DG_KIND_OPTS.box`** rather than in a kind test at the call site: put in the table it narrows the statement, the `default` block, the linter and the editor's option row from one edit, and `dgTakes` names it in a refusal without being told about it. Emitted as a `<path>` whose `d` comes from the same `[x,y,w,h]` a `<rect>` carries; `dgShapeD` is stringified into the runtime by build.js so one text draws the opening beat and every later one. An outline written on any kind but `box` – in an element's own tail or in a `default` for another kind – is refused by the general class gate below, which is the same rule for every class rather than a special case for these five. An outline inside a `style` step is refused separately, because the drawable kind is decided once, at emit, so a step would have nothing to switch.
- **`.turn`** – a label read bottom-to-top, for a tall narrow element that has room for a word only along its long side. The angle rides as a third number on the label's geometry vector, so it is carried and interpolated by the machinery that already moves an upright one. **Four sites position a label** – the node label, the container caption, the brace label, the edge label – and all four have to write the angle; for a while only the first did, and on the other three the class resolved, emitted its CSS and rotated nothing. `dgTurnOf()` is the one place that answers the question now. A turned label is also anchored `middle` whatever its kind would otherwise use, because `extentsOf` reserves it that way and a drawn anchor disagreeing with the reserved one puts the words half outside the frame. **`extentsOf` and `sizeOf` both swap the label's measurements**; reserving the upright box would frame the figure around something nowhere near what the browser paints, which is exactly what `test/figure-framing.mjs` exists to catch.
- **`bars`, `grid`, `plot`, `table`, `lanes`, `sequence`, `zone`** – seven statements that **expand at parse time** into ordinary boxes, texts and edges (`zone` is the newest and the smallest: one box and one text; the six below it are the ones that go through `readGridOpts`). Nothing downstream learns a new element kind, which is why `brace over f-0,f-1,f-2` spans three columns of a chart with no special handling anywhere. What makes it possible is that an `at` may name another element's coordinate: every column, cell and gridline is placed against a frame the same statement creates, through the ordinary topological walk. `plot` additionally registers a mapping so `roc@0.35` names a value in its own units; `dgResolvePlotCoords` turns that into a plain `roc.left+n` once the block has been read, so a point may name a plot written further down. **`cell` and `space` on a `grid` are measured in `uh` on both axes**, the same call `pad` made, because a cell has to be square. The spacing inside one of these statements is `space`, never `gap`: a placement on the same line already uses `gap` for the distance to another element, and one word for both meant a `gap` written before the placement and one written after it produced drawings five times apart, with no error either way. All six of those go through `readGridOpts`, which now knows three more shapes of option: `DG_LIST_OPTS` (`col` plus the three prominence words – a comma list, so a single-number parser must not read one and report the whole string as "not a number"), `DG_BARE_OPTS` (bare closed words a statement accepts, `{bars: ['stacked', 'horizontal'], sequence: ['unnumbered'], table: ['unheaded']}`) and `DG_RATIO_OPTS` (`aspect`, a `W:H` token read by `dgParseRatio`).
- **`table` and `lanes`** came out of the arrangement pass, and both exist because the hand-built version is the one that cannot be maintained. A `table` is a grid of *labelled* cells – six rows of three cost twenty-one declarations and a chain of `below` references that has to be re-aimed whenever a row is inserted. Its heading is one quoted string split on `|`, its body is the run of bare quoted strings on the lines beneath it, `col` is one width per column, `w` is the **frame** – the total, divided equally, and refused alongside `col` because the two say one number twice – and `row` is the height of **one row**. It is `row` and not `h` for the reason `lanes` says `band` and `sequence` says `header`: on a box, a text, a `bars` or a `plot`, `h` is the element's height, and on these three it was the height of one unit of a repeating thing, so an author reading it as "how tall is this" was wrong by a factor of the row count – silently, and in the direction that still draws a plausible picture. `space` on a table is square in `uh`, like a `grid`'s: a table's whole promise is regularity, and one number that meant `uw` across and `uh` down put 30.0px between two columns and 10.4px between two rows on a `150x52` grid. Cells are `dgCellName(id, c, r)` (`t-1-2`, column then row, row 0 being the heading) and each carries two **generated tags**, `dgRowTag` / `dgColTag` (`@t-row-2`, `@t-col-0`) – and a row lit per beat is then one line of source. The attribute tail lands on the **cells**, not on the frame: the frame is always `.bare .clear`, and the heading row additionally gets `.bold` and nothing else, so a tinted heading is the author's own step or tail. **A cell is an ordinary box, so the tail is the box vocabulary**, and `table t "Attack | Layer | Countermeasure" at 0,0 col 1.0,0.45,1.35 row 0.42 {.clear .bare .left .large}` is the spelling a table of prose wants: `.clear` no fill, `.bare` no outline – together, cells that are type on the paper rather than a grid of boxes – `.left` the text ranged left instead of centred, which is what a column of words reads as, and `.large` a step up in size for a table that is the slide. Each is a slot of the box table, so the four are independent and any of them can be left out; a fill or a tone written here tints **every** cell, which is why a heading row or a lit row is a `style @t-row-N` step and not a word in this tail. **And one column with an alignment of its own is a `default box @t-col-N`, not a word in the tail either.** A table of values wants the label column ranged left beside value columns that are centred, and `{.left}` on the `table` line reaches all of them. Centred is what a cell arrives as, so only the column that differs says anything: `default box @sp-col-0 {.left}` above `table sp " | technisch | organisatorisch" at 0,0 col 2.09,0.73,1.11 row 0.48 {.clear .bare .large}` gives the keynote's self-check table a left-hand column of subjects and two centred columns of answers. `@t-row-N` is the same handle one axis over, and the two compose. It is a `default` and not a `style` step, and that is the whole answer rather than half of one: `.left` and `.right` are in `DG_STEP_FIXED` because an anchor is baked once when the figure is built, so a step cannot carry either, and a tag default is the layer that acts from beat 0. **The trap beside it is ordinary precedence rather than anything a table invents**: the tail lands on the cells as their *own* classes, and an element's own class beats every default layer – so a table written `{.left}` cannot have a column centred again, by `{!left}` or by anything else. Put the alignment on the columns that differ, never on the table line. `lanes l …` makes a frame, flush `.clear` bands `dgLaneName(id, i)` → `l-0`, `l-1`… (the prefix is the statement's own name, so `lanes swim …` gives `swim-0`; the name is not a keyword) and `.turn`ed captions outside the left edge, `dgLaneCapName(id, i)` → `l-cap-0`. **Place a box in a band by naming that band's coordinate**, `at l.left+0.9,l-1.cy`. **A band's height is the `band` value, and a `.turn`ed caption longer than that height overflows into the neighbouring caption** – the compiler does not warn (a lane caption is a generated element, outside `dgLabelClipWarnings`), so a long name like `Drittanbieter` wants a taller `band`. **It is deliberately not a container**: a container fits its members, so lanes holding different numbers of things come out ragged at both ends, which is the opposite of what a swimlane means. `lanes` and `sequence` are the two statements authors pick the wrong one of, and they are one pair with the axes swapped – `lanes` puts who down the side and lets the reading direction carry the time, `sequence` puts who across the top and makes the vertical axis the time itself. Steps parcelled out to the people responsible for them is the first; messages passing between them is the second.
- **`sequence` draws a protocol down the page, and it owns exactly one thing: the vertical rhythm.** A row of actor heads, a lifeline under each, numbered messages between them, notes on a lifeline. Written out by hand every message carries a y coordinate of its own, so inserting one in the middle means moving every message under it, renumbering all of them and re-guessing how far the lifelines run – **measured on the WebAuthn figure in `lectures/diagrams`: 13 lines written to insert one message, against 1 line with the statement** – and a note box taller than the guessed step cuts silently into the label beneath it. Here every entry states the height it needs (a message its label's, a note its text's, a self-message its loop's) and the statement stacks the bands, so a note pushes what follows it down. It sizes itself across as well: all heads are one width, the widest label plus its padding, because a row of peers drawn ragged reads as an accident. `w`, `header` and `space` are overrides nobody normally writes – `w` is the whole frame, which the actors divide into equal columns, `header` the height of one actor head, and `header` rather than `head` because a sequence is full of arrowheads.

  **`space n` on a `note` or a message line is that one band's own gap**, and it is what breaks a dense protocol into phases. It is a keyword *on the entry's own line* – `br -> trk "GET /t.js" space 0.5`, never a `space` line of its own (that drops out of the entry run and is reported as an unknown statement on every line beneath it) – and the gap it opens sits *above* that entry rather than below it, which is also how the statement now stacks: one gap before each band instead of one after, the same rhythm read the other way round, so the entry's own number is a substitution and not an exception. Refused on an `actor` (the heads are one row and there is no band above them) and refused negative (a band pulled into the one above it draws one label through another), because both are otherwise a silent no-op, which this grammar refuses rather than ignores. **A blank line cannot do this job**: the entry run reads *through* blank lines, and every real sequence measured already used them to separate the actors from the messages – giving them a height would have moved those figures with nobody writing anything.

  Its lines are a **sub-grammar of three shapes** – `actor <name> "<label>"`, `note <actor>[,<actor>] "<text>"`, and `<actor> -> <actor> "<label>" ["<second line>"]` – and the run of them is the **third and last lookahead in this parser**, for the same reason as a table's rows and a chart's series: the frame's geometry is a function of what comes after it. One thing differs from a table and both files have to agree on it exactly: **a blank line does not end the run**, because a protocol runs to fifteen lines and wants its phases separated. What ends it is **a line opening with a statement keyword, or any line that is not an entry**. So a typo in the middle sends every line after it to the unknown-statement gate, and both the build and `lint.js` say what it is rather than reporting a keyword nobody wrote. The keyword half of that test is newer than the rest and it closed a real trap: an annotation carrying an arrow token – `text n "…" right of wa-3 gap 0.9 -- wa-3`, which is how a note is hung off a message – *looked* like a message, so written as the first line under the entries it was swallowed by the run and reported as actors named `1` and `wa-3`. Three complaints, none containing the word `text`. Worse, it was **order-dependent**: a `brace` above it ended the run and both lines then compiled, so whether an annotation parsed depended on which annotation came first, with nothing an author could see to say why. `DG_KEYWORDS` is the same table the unknown-statement gate answers from, so the rule is one already learned – a line that opens with a statement is a statement. **It costs a name, and the cost is refused rather than left to be discovered.** An `actor` called `text` or `box` is refused on its own declaration, because a message begins with its sender and that actor could therefore never be sent one – left open it produced `"->" is not a usable name` two lines further down, which names neither the actor nor the collision. A *named* message whose name is a statement word is the same collision with no answer at all: `edge a -> b "hi"` is a message named `edge` and an ordinary `edge` between the two heads, and nothing in it decides which – so it is refused too, and only when both its ends really are actors of that sequence, which is what keeps an annotation that merely contains an arrow (`edge wa-0 -> far`) out of it. Both are mirrored in `lint.js`. The pre-scan that answers *is this token an actor* has one rule worth keeping: it steps over a line only where that line could structurally **be** an entry - an anonymous message has a plain name before its arrow, a named one has a statement word, a name and the arrow at index 2, and an annotation has neither shape. Stepping over anything that merely *carries* an arrow walks past a terminating `text … -- …` and gathers actors belonging to no sequence. **Indentation was the other candidate and is declined**: it is grammatical nowhere else in this parser (a `step`'s own operations compile unindented), and making whitespace significant in exactly one construct is the trap this rule removes, not a second spelling of it. `->` / `<-` / `--` / `<->` are the edge's own arrow tokens, `{.dashed}` is the edge's own class – **a message is an edge**, so nothing about arrow styles is new vocabulary. `<->` used to be the exception that made that sentence false, and adding it was a diagnostics fix as much as a vocabulary one: a token this sub-grammar does not know drops the line out of the entry run, and the run's own recovery message then fires on every line beneath it, so one guessable token cost three errors, none of which contained the string it was about. It was then the exception a second time, and more quietly: the token was *accepted* while the expansion still kept a one-bit arrow model ("was it `--`"), so `<->` compiled and drew exactly like `->`. The entry carries the **token**, `DG_ARROW_CLASS` answers it, and both the class it seeds and the `.paper` ground the expansion adds ride on `autoClasses`, so the panel never writes either back as the author's – which matters because a head class in a message tail is refused, exactly as it is in an edge's, in both signs and by both files. An acceptance fixture said the token parsed for a whole revision; `test/gates/semantics.mjs` is the gate that asks what it drew.

  **A message label is emitted with a side and a ground already chosen, and both are corrections rather than features.** A lifeline crosses every label in the figure – that is what a lifeline *is* – so the ground is the default (`.paper`, opted out of with `.clear`, displaced by a written `.tone-n` because they share the fill slot) rather than something an author has to notice. And it needs the side, because the edge emitter reads a fill with no side as "put the words *on* the line and knock it out behind them": `{.paper}` on a message used to swallow the whole arrow, label as wide as the arrow and nothing else drawn. The side is written on the edge record as `side top` on an ordinary message and `side right` on a self-message, whose loop is read as vertical at its middle, and an author's own `side` on the message line still wins. It is the `side` **option** and not a class, the same shape `space n` on the entry already has – injecting it as a class made it something an author could displace with a class of their own, which was a second way of saying what one option now says once. The clearance is `DG_SEQ_GROUND`, 0.1 grid units, written on the element as `pad` – the box padding a `pad` would otherwise resolve to is 13 by 9, which behind two words is a slab. The second, smaller line takes the same fill and clears the arrow by its own ground, or the rect is painted across the arrow it belongs to. All of it is decided in the expansion and not at emit, because **the band above has to reserve exactly what the emitter will draw** – that is the one thing `sequence` owns, and reserving the other case is a guessed rhythm again. `<actor> -> <actor>` with the same name on both sides is a self-message, which loops out of the lifeline and back; twelve of the seventy-seven messages in the measured corpus are one.

  **Which of the two strings goes above the line is fixed, and stays fixed.** The first is the message's *name* and sits over the arrow; the second is its *payload* and sits under it, smaller. There is no word for swapping them, and none should be added on the strength of a hypothetical: all nine sequence diagrams in the measured corpus (`psi-slides-mylectures/lectures/advasp`, 77 messages) write one string per message, so not one of them needs the second line at all, let alone the other way round. A word that freezes with the first tagged release deserves a case that exists.

  **There is no `alt` / `else`**: `container … pad n` with a caption already encloses and names a group of messages, and two of the nine figures in the measured corpus wanted it. **The numbers are on by default** (`unnumbered` takes them away), because renumbering by hand was the second of the two edits the statement exists to remove, and because the visible number and the generated tag carry the same index – `@wa-msg-3` is the arrow the audience reads as 4.

- **The generated names of a `sequence` are a promised interface, not an implementation detail**, because a real lecture annotates such a figure heavily. An `at` may name another element's coordinate and an edge has a box in `layoutDiagram`, so an annotation in the middle of a protocol is an ordinary line: `text n "…" right of wa-3 gap 0.9 -- wa-3`, `brace br over wa-3,wa-4,wa-5 "over CTAP" side left`, a `container` around a phase. The names, mirrored by `lint.js` and exercised by `test/figure-sequence.mjs`:

  | | |
  |---|---|
  | actor head | the name its own `actor` line gives it |
  | lifeline | `dgLifeName(actor)` → `au-life` |
  | message *i* (0-based; the number drawn is *i*+1) | `dgMsgName(seq, i)` → `wa-3`, or the name the line writes before its from-actor |
  | its number | `dgMsgNumName(seq, i)` → `wa-n-3` |
  | its second line | `dgMsgSubName(seq, i)` → `wa-sub-3` |
  | note *j* | `dgNoteName(seq, j)` → `wa-note-0` |
  | one message, with its number and second line | tag `dgMsgTag(seq, i)` → `@wa-msg-3` |
  | every message; every message touching an actor | tag `dgMsgsTag(x)` → `@wa-msgs`, `@au-msgs` |
  | every note / head / lifeline | tags `@wa-notes`, `@wa-actors`, `@wa-lives` |

- **`w` and `h` are grid units, and a grid cell is not square** – which makes them a poor way to say what shape a chart is. On a `150x52` grid a plot written `w 1.9 h 1.5` lands 285px by 78px, very wide and very flat, and nothing on the line says so. **`aspect W:H`** on a `bars` or a `plot` states the proportion the reader sees and lets `applyAspect` work the other number out; `aspect 4:3`, `aspect 1:1`, or one bare number meaning that many wide to one tall. Giving `w`, `h` *and* `aspect` is an error, because two ways of saying one number is two ways of saying different ones. **`same as <chart>` is the third way to size one**, and it is answered at *parse time* rather than at layout time like a box's: a chart's gridlines, ticks and columns are placed from its own `w` and `h` while the line is read, so a size that only arrived during layout would size the frame and leave everything inside it where the old numbers put it. The price is that the chart being copied has to be declared first, and `sameAsFrame` says so rather than drawing something. It tells three failures apart, and the middle one needs a pre-scan of the block to be nameable at all: `model.byId` fills as lines are read, so a chart *below* the line has not been claimed yet and is indistinguishable from a typo. This is the one place in the grammar where a dimension is stated in page terms rather than grid terms, and it is stated that way precisely because the grid is the thing obscuring it.
- **`horizontal` on a `bars` line turns the chart on its side**, and it is not a variant so much as the reading a comparison usually wants: lengths from a shared left edge are easier to rank than heights from a shared floor, and a category called "DNS cache poisoning" cannot be written under an upright column at all. One expansion serves both, because every number in it is worked out in px along two named axes – `along` (the value) and `across` (the categories) – and written back as grid units at the end. Two things swap with the orientation and nothing else does: the tick strip becomes a right-aligned column down the left margin, **each label placed by its own measured width** (a free `text` is centred on its placement point whatever `.right` says about the anchor, so centring cannot line up right edges), and the baseline stands on the left instead of lying underneath. **A tick string containing `|` is split on that instead of on spaces** – the same mark that separates a `table` row and a `lanes` name, and the only way a flat chart's row labels can be phrases.
- **`bars g "…" series of f [stacked]`** joins the first chart's frame instead of drawing its own, and refuses `w`, `h`, `space`, a placement and a tick strip by name – all five belong to the chart it joined, and a number the drawing ignores is a silent no-op, so it is refused rather than read and dropped. Plain, a series stands beside the runs before it and the cell is shared out, so a grouped chart takes exactly the paper a single one did; `stacked`, it sits on the run before it and the scale becomes the tallest stack. It is spelled as its own statement rather than folded into the values string for two reasons that are worth keeping: **each series then has its own attribute tail**, which is how a series gets a colour and a tag of its own, and the generated names stay the flat `f-0`, `g-0` instead of becoming conditionally two-level. `emph 1,3` / `dim 4` / `ghost 0` on any `bars` line take **column indices** – the same act of emphasis a `step` and a class carry, but addressed by position because a bar has no name of its own at that point. **In a `step` the same verbs take element *names*, not indices**: the columns are `f-0`, `f-1`… once the chart is expanded, so it is `step s / emph f-2, f-3`, and `emph 2, 3` in a step is refused as an undefined reference (the build and `lint.js` both name it). The line form exists because without it a column could be singled out from beat 1 onwards and never in the picture the figure opens with, which is where a chart usually wants one. An index out of range is an error naming the range. **A column is emitted with `bare` prepended** – displaced by the author's own `.thick` through the stroke-weight slot, the way `sharp` is displaced by an outline class – and carries `role: 'bar'`, which the emitter writes into the group's base class string as `dg-bar` (in `data-base`, so the runtime's per-frame rebuild keeps it). Everything the stylesheet does with that class is generated from one table, `DG_BAR_FILLS`: the fill of a column with no tone, the four tones at a column's strength (a box tone is mixed pale for the label's sake; a column has none and the same mix is a watermark on a projector), and `emph` as a solid accent fill rather than the accent outline it is on every other shape. `dgBarFillCss()` writes the rules into build.js's stylesheet and `dgBarContrast()` reads the same table for the linter, which measures every run against the paper of all seven themes (`DG_THEMES`, held to build.js by a gate) and warns under `DG_BAR_CONTRAST_MIN`, naming the themes (`diagram-bar-contrast`). An outline on a column is ink that encodes nothing, and at 1.4 it never matched the 1.05 baseline it stood on. **`key "2023"` names a run** – the one keyed option whose value is a quoted string, so `readGridOpts` only notes the word and the bars statement takes the string off the raw token list, keeping it out of the positional quoted tokens the tick strip is read from – and the chart draws the legend: `<id>-key`, a swatch that is a column of the run (same classes, `role: 'bar'`, so the same fill by construction), and `<id>-key-label` beside it, in a row above the frame's top-left corner; a series appends to the row of the chart it joined off a running x on the frame's geometry record. In a grouped chart `emph` on two runs at one index paints both in the accent, and on a `.tone-4` run it changes nothing – the linter warns on both (`diagram-bars-emph`) and points at `dim` on the other columns.
- **`zone <name> at X,Y w W h H "Label" {classes}` is a named area, and it is a statement because two of its three differences from a `box` are not properties of a box at all.** It is painted **under everything, whatever line it is written on**, so an area can be declared after the things standing in it – which is the order an author writes in, because the area's size comes from its contents; its label sits in a **corner** rather than in the middle, because the middle of an area is where the contents go (top-left, with `.right` and `.bottom` moving it – the element-label alignment words one level out, which is why it invents no `corner` option to say the same thing again); and it holds **from beat 0**, which is the whole difference from a `container`: a container fits its members and is invisible without them, while an area is a claim on the paper that holds whether anything is standing in it yet or not. Its size may be written or taken from its contents – an axis with no `w` / `h` is settled by what is placed `in` it, which is the half of the split that has closed. Five figures in one real keynote needed exactly that – two named regions from the first beat, filling up as the talk went on – and the workaround was a `box {.dashed .clear}` plus a `text`, which drew an overlap warning per child.

  **The caption sits a third of a row inside the corner, and `pad n` is what moves it.** `DG_ZONE_PAD` is 0.33, square in px on both axes (the x nudge is scaled by `uh/uw` at the statement, the correction `gap` and `pad` already make). It was 0.16 – just under a sixth – and an area's outline is a dashed line while its caption is 12 px type, so the words sat *on* the dashes: measured on a keynote's "zu Hause", the glyphs crossed the frame at two corners of one figure, which reads as a box that failed to fit its own label. **At the bottom corner it is a little more**, by `DG_ZONE_INK_DROP` (0.17) of the caption's own font: what a reader compares is the distance from the dashes to the nearest ink, and a line of type does not sit centred in its own box - a cap stops well short of the box's top edge while a descender nearly reaches its bottom one, so a `.bottom` caption with a `g` in it stood 2 px closer to the outline than a top one did on a 120x72 grid. `zone … pad 0.6` overrides the inset in grid units like every other `pad`; the word was in `DG_KIND_OPTS.zone` from the start and read nothing at all, which is the silent no-op this grammar refuses everywhere else. The same `pad` sets the **band** below, so a caption inset and the room its contents get are one number and not two that have to be kept equal by hand.

  **Under the caption the band keeps half a caption line of air.** `DG_ZONE_CAP_GAP` is 0.5, in the caption's own fonts rather than in rows, and it is part of the band's `cap`: `z.inner.top`, `in z` and an auto-sized area all start below it, and an area without a caption reserves none. Before it the first box `in z` began on the row where the caption's line ended – five pixels from "zu Hause" to the outline of the box under it, which reads as a label naming the box rather than the area. It reaches only what is placed through the band: a box written `above` another one that stands `in z bottom` is placed by that box and can still land against the caption, and the answer there is `in z` on the upper box.

  **The band, `in`, and the size the contents settle – three things, and they are one idea.** An area
  reserves a band for what stands in it: itself minus `pad` on all four sides, minus the caption's own
  line on the side the caption is on. `z.inner.left` / `.right` / `.cx` and `z.inner.top` / `.bottom` /
  `.cy` are that rectangle, addressable like any element's six scalars, and `in z` is the placement
  that meets it – top-left by default, with `left` / `right` / `top` / `bottom` / `center` bare after
  the zone moving it (`DG_IN_ALIGN`, the caption's own four plus the one a corner does not need), and
  `gap n` inset from the band's edge. **`center` alone answers both axes**, so an axis
  centred while the other is not has to spell the other one out – `in z center` is the
  middle of the band and `in z left center` is its left edge, halfway down – and the words
  are resolved once the run of them has been read, so their order changes nothing. They are words of the *placement* and not classes, because on a
  box `.left` already says where the label sits inside the outline, and one word cannot answer two
  questions on one line; `anchor` and `flush` are refused on it and say so, because a band is neither a
  coordinate nor a face. **`row a, b, c in z center` places the whole run**, centred as a block:
  sizes are settled before positions are, so the run's extent is answerable before a member of it has
  been placed, and this is the one thing no coordinate on one member's line can state. A member of
  such a row may not state a placement of its own – the row is placing all of them.

  **`w` / `h` are optional, per axis, and an axis nobody writes is the one the contents settle.** The
  zone then wraps everything placed `in` it plus the band and the pad, like a container, while keeping
  its ground, its caption and its place under everything, like an area. It is **not** re-fitted per
  beat the way a container is: an area holds from beat 0, and a frame that grew as the talk filled it
  would move every caption under it. Three consequences worth knowing. Only `in` is membership – a
  chain that runs on from a child (`right of a gap 4`) runs on *out* of the area, which is what the
  keynote figures hanging a note off a box in a zone depend on. An axis the contents settled cannot
  also be aligned against (`in z right` under an auto width is "the band is exactly this run"), and
  that is an error rather than a guess. And an area with an auto axis and nothing in it is refused: it
  has no size to take from anywhere. The layout runs **twice** to answer this – the children's union is
  invariant under moving the zone, so the second pass, which knows the size and therefore where an
  anchor or a centre puts the frame, moves everything together and changes no extent.

  **A zone with written numbers that its contents do not fit in warns** (`box a … is 59 px wider than
  the band z reserves`), naming the child, the axis and the number to write instead. Only what is
  placed `in` the zone is measured, and only at beats where nothing has moved it: what this reads is a
  placement, and a `move` step is an act.

  **It expands at parse time into a box and a text**, so nothing downstream learns an element kind: `at` names it, `.cx` and `.top` address it, a `step` shows, hides and emphasises it, and a `brace` can span it. Three details are load-bearing. The frame carries `synth` set to its **own id**, the discriminator that already keeps a `table`'s and a `lanes`'s frame out of `dgOverlapWarnings`, so a box standing in an area is not reported as a collision. The caption carries `leaderRef` set to the zone, so it is only as visible as the area it names through the face of the visibility closure that already says a text is only as visible as what it hangs off – `hide z` takes both. And its look, `.clear .dashed .muted`, is **seeded and displaced through the slots** the way a column's `bare` is: `{.tone-2}` replaces the see-through fill, `{.dotted}` the dash, `{.accent}` the muted ink, and none of the three is written back by the editor as the author's. Generated names: `dgZoneCapName(id)` (`z-cap`) and the tag `dgZoneTag(id)` (`@z-parts`), which holds the pair. Drawing order is the one thing that could not be an expansion detail, so `renderDiagram` puts every `zone` at the head of its `elements` list.
- **A `table`'s first row is a heading, and `unheaded` says it is not.** The bare word `unnumbered` already has this shape one statement along (`DG_BARE_OPTS`), and this one takes away exactly the `bold`: the first quoted string is still the row that fixes the column count, `dgCellName(id, c, 0)` is still its cells and `@t-row-0` still names it. A table of pairs – a key/value block, a legend, a run of definitions – had no way to be written, and the workaround, a heading of empty strings, drew an empty bold row that still took its height.
- **A `table`'s row height follows its type size.** `row` is the author's own number and still wins; absent, the default is `DG_ROW_H` **scaled by `dgFontFor` of the written tail**, so `{.large}` no longer puts 22.9 px of type in a box 21.8 px tall and nobody has to work `row 0.8` out by hand. The base case is untouched by construction, because the factor is exactly 1 when no size class is written. Off the **written tail** and not the resolved classes, for the reason a chart's `same as` is answered at parse time: the frame's geometry is fixed while the line is read, before any `default box` layer exists.
- **A whole line of a multi-line label written in the quiet mark is a second register.** `text f "1  Wer macht es grün?\n~abfedern~"` draws the question in the reading size and the verb under it at `DG_QUIET_SCALE` (0.8, the same factor `.small` is – a figure has one small size and a second nearly equal one is a drawing that looks mis-set) in the muted ink the mark already gives it. The construction it exists for is a question over the verb that answers it, which written as **two** `text` elements cannot be centred on the cell it labels: each is anchored to the cell's centre line on its own, so a two-line question over a one-line verb stands half a line too high and the author moves the split by hand – `cy-0.1` / `cy+0.1` on one row and `cy+0.5` / `cy+0.7` on the next, measured on a keynote's build plan. As one label it is one block and the ordinary centring does it, so both rows are written the same way whatever their line counts. **The rule is the whole line, in a label of more than one**, and the second half is the rule rather than a guard on it: a register exists in contrast to another register, so on a one-line label `~…~` stays what it always was, the muted colour, and `{.small}` is how a whole label is made small. `dgMeasure` carries a per-line scale and `dgTextEl` walks the baselines down the measured block instead of stepping one pitch, which is the same arithmetic when every line is at scale 1 – a label with no second register draws the bytes it always did, and `dgTspans` emits a `font-size` only where the span differs from the `<text>`'s own. Corpus cost: `lectures/diagrams#goals`, whose last line was a whole line in the mark; its wording moved one word so the register break falls at a clause boundary, and the figure is now the specimen.
- **`same as X` on a `table` copies the columns, and only the columns.** Two tables stacked so their columns line up meant writing `col 1.7,2.0,0.12` twice, in two places nothing said were meant to stay equal – measured on a keynote's `#vorgang`. What is copied is the widths **and the `space` between them**, because a column's *position* is both numbers and copying one of the pair lines up nothing; a `space` written on the copying table's own line still wins, and its rows stay its own. It is answered while the line is read, off a `tableCols` map filled as each table settles, for the reason a chart's `same as` is: a table's cells are placed against its own frame at parse time, so a width arriving later would move the frame and leave the cells where the old numbers put them. Four refusals, all four mirrored in `lint.js` because all four are decidable from the line order and the two heading strings: `same as` beside `col` or `w` (one size said twice), a table declared **below** it, a name that is not a table, and a copy of a table with a different number of columns.
- **`.smooth`** – the same waypoint vector drawn as a Catmull-Rom spline instead of straight segments. Interpolating, so the curve passes *through* every waypoint and the class never moves a line off what it was attached to. The skew warning exempts it: on a curve a nearly-flat stretch is the shape, not two ends that missed each other.
- **`.elbow`** shares a slot with it – `['smooth', 'elbow']`, "how a line is drawn" – and is the one place the engine puts a coordinate on the page the author did not write. It draws its own two waypoints: a rail across the gap, on whichever axis the two ends are further apart, with the leaving and arriving anchors forced onto that axis whatever `dgAutoAnchor` would have picked from the straight line between them (an anchor the author wrote still wins). It is bounded so that it does not become routing: it looks at nothing else in the figure, nothing steps around an obstacle, and the author has no option to move the rail. **`.elbow` with `via` is an error, not a preference the build guesses at** – both halves are on the one line, so `lint.js` decides it too, though only for a class written on the line itself; one arriving through a `default edge` layer is the build's to resolve, the same restraint the `.fit` check shows.
- **The rail is halfway across that gap, and the *arrival run* is the one thing that moves it.** The run after the rail is all a reader has to tell which box the arrow points into – the rail itself is shared, which is exactly what makes a tree bracket read as one shape – and on a small gap half of that run is the arrowhead. So where halfway would leave it under `DG_ELBOW_ARRIVE` (`DG_LABEL_H + DG_HEAD`, 27.75 px), `railAt` in `dgEdgeRoute` slides the rail **toward the source** until the arrival run is exactly that, never past halfway and never leaving less than `DG_ELBOW_LEAVE` (`DG_HEAD`, 9 px) behind it. Three consequences worth knowing. The offset is a function of the span alone, so **two edges out of one parent still land their rails on one line** – the bracket survives. A gap of twice the floor or more is untouched, which is why almost the whole corpus drew identically after the change. And where the gap cannot pay for both runs the rail stays halfway and `dgEdgeShortWarnings` says so, because the fix is then a number on the boxes and the route has no business inventing one. Measured on a real keynote: two boxes 30 px apart put the rail at 15 px, and against a `.dashed` target the head read as resting on the dashes rather than arriving at them.
- **The three outline looks, and all three are stated as multiples of the line they pattern.** The stroke pattern slot is `['dashed', 'dotted']` and the absence of both is solid; the weight slot beside it is `['thick', 'bare']`. What ties them together is **`--dg-sw`**, a custom property set in `build.js` beside every `stroke-width` in the diagram stylesheet, on the same element and by the same selector – 1.4 px plain, 1.3 on a `container`, 1.05 under `.muted`, 2.6 under `.thick` and `.emph` – so the dash arithmetic can never disagree with the line it is drawn on.
  - **solid** – nothing written.
  - **`.dashed`** – `stroke-dasharray: calc(--dg-sw * 2.2) calc(--dg-sw * 1.5)`, butt caps. At the plain weight that is 3.08 px of ink and 2.1 px of paper. It was a flat `6 4`, which at 1.4 px is 4.3 line-widths of ink against 2.9 of paper: a dashed box then drew the eye harder than the solid one beside it, and on a `.round` corner (13 px radius) a 10 px period put one or two dashes on the whole arc, so a gap landing on the apex read as a chipped box. Nothing divides a rounded rectangle's perimeter evenly, so the seam cannot be removed; a small dash with a small gap hides it. Butt caps deliberately – a round cap adds half a line-width of ink at each end and would put the dash back where it started.
  - **`.dotted`** – `stroke-dasharray: 0 calc(--dg-sw * 2.5)` with `stroke-linecap: round`, which is what makes it *dots*: a zero-length dash under a round cap draws a disc one line-width across, and the gap is 2.5 of those. It was `1.5 3.5` with the round cap on top, a 2.9 px dash at the plain weight – a fine dashed line under another name – and at `.thick` a 4.1 px dash with 0.9 px of paper between it, so the dotted specimen in the class catalogue was very nearly solid.
  - **`.dotted .muted` is floored at the plain weight** – `stroke-width: max(var(--dg-sw), 1.4px)` and the gap stated against the same `max()`, on `.muted.dotted` only. A dot is one line-width across and `.muted` makes that 1.05, so the pair drew 1.9 px discs at a typical figure scale, anti-aliased below their own colour (peak 2.56:1 on the light themes, where a solid muted line reaches 2.76) and carrying a quarter of a muted line's ink or less on all seven themes; it was the one pair in the vocabulary two steps below everything else. With the floor it is `.dotted`'s pattern in `.muted`'s ink. Two alternatives were measured and turned down: the muted *word*'s colour mix on the stroke gains on the light themes and loses on the three dark ones, and a gentler `.muted` on every broken stroke would move every `zone` (`.clear .dashed .muted`) in the corpus, where `.dashed .muted` already reads one step below `.muted`. `max()` rather than 1.4, so a `.thick` or `.emph` line keeps its 2.6. **A `plot`'s grid is this pair**, written by the compiler (`gridCls`), and is most of what the floor reaches. `test/figure-dotted.mjs`.
  - **`.thick`** is the only thing that moves either number, and it moves both, because the pattern is a ratio. Under the old flat pixels a thick line got the same dash on twice the weight, which is the one case `6 4` was actually tuned for – so `.thick` is where the two patterns changed least (5.72 / 3.9 against 6 / 4) and the plain weight is where they changed most.
- **An edge endpoint may be a bare coordinate, and that is how an arrow comes in from outside the picture.** `edge 0,1.5 -> mail` starts at a point on the grid with no box behind it; `edge mail -> 0,1.5` is the same thing pointing out; `edge -0.45,0 -- 6.1,0 {.muted}` is a rule under a row with nothing at either end. A component may name an element like any other coordinate (`edge q1 -> 2.20,q1.cy`), because `dgParsePair` is the one coordinate grammar behind `at`, `move … to`, waypoints and endpoints alike. It is a **literal and deliberately not an invisible `dot`**: there is nothing to delete by accident, and a graphical editor answering a drag rewrites two numbers on that line instead of moving an object nobody can see – which is what `dgeStartEndpoint` does, and what `test/editor-edges.mjs` pins (*"the edge tool starting on an arrow uses a coordinate, never the arrow name"*). Three things to know. **No space after the comma**: an endpoint is exactly one token, and `0, 1.5` puts `0,` in the optional name slot and is refused as a bad name. A free end contributes **no dependency**, so it cannot make a placement cycle. And the visibility closure does not run downhill through one – `edge 0,1.5 -> mail` goes dark when `mail` does, and the free end never darkens anything. Five edges in the corpus are written this way (`lectures/diagrams` `#look`-era rule, four in `lectures/network-security`).

- **A label its own line runs through gets a halo.** The offset that lifts an ungrounded label off its line clears it at the *midpoint* and knows nothing else about the route, so an elbow's two outer runs, a doubled-back `via` and a curve that comes back on itself can all be drawn through the middle of the words – which a room reads as struck through. `dgSegmentsCrossBox` tests the label's ink box against the drawn route at each beat, and where it crosses, the beat's class string gains `dg-halo` and the stylesheet knocks the glyph shapes out of the line with `paint-order: stroke fill` in the paper. A **halo and not the ground rect**, for two reasons: a rect is decided by the fill slot, so producing one would mean writing a fill class the author did not write, which feeds back into `grounded` and moves the words *onto* the line; and a rect is as wide as the whole run where the crossing is one word long, which on a curve erases the arc the label belongs to – the mistake `dgLabelGroundWarnings` reports one layer along. A label that already carries a fill is left alone. **A free `text` some *other* line runs through is deliberately not covered**, and the reason is the reason `dgOverlapWarnings` and this are two rules: the compiler cannot tell an arrow crossing a note from a rule drawn through a row of labels on purpose, and `lectures/diagrams` `#anchors` is the second - one dashed rule through two rows, where the crossing *is* the argument of the figure. An edge's own label is the case with no such reading. A note on somebody else's line is the author's to ground with `{.paper}`, or to write as that edge's label and let the offset carry it clear.

- **An edge's label can carry a ground, and `side` is what lifts it off the line.** A fill class on an `edge` draws a rect behind the label; `pad` and `side` are the two `edge` options (`DG_KIND_OPTS.edge = ['pad', 'side']`). With no `side` the label sits **on** the line and knocks it out behind the words; with one it clears the line and sits beside it, ground and all. Before the ground existed, `.paper` on an edge resolved, emitted its class and drew nothing.

  **The side is an option and not the four alignment classes, and that is the correction.** On a `box`, a `dot` or a free `text` those four are two independent channels – `.left`/`.right` place a horizontal run of text, `.top`/`.bottom` the block of lines – so the same four words meant two different geometries chosen by kind, and `{.top .left}` on an edge was writable although an edge has exactly one side to pick. `side` follows the precedent `point` set: a chevron aimed up is the same shape aimed differently, and one keyed option beats four classes that only some kinds can reach. The four are refused on an edge now, by the same class gate that refuses an outline there.

  Two halves of the free `text`'s rule apply here for two different reasons. Whether the rect is *emitted* follows `dgHasFill(st.classes) || styleFilled.has(id)` – every frame of any edge that ever carries a tone, or a geometry key present in only some frames strands the rect in the others. Whether the words sit **on** the line follows `dgHasFill(st.classes)` alone, this beat's classes and not "ever filled", so a `style` step that adds a tone moves the label onto the line in the same beat it paints the ground under it and the runtime tweens the pair as one act. Only the pair of words that lies *across* the line can name a side; the pair running along it is warned about and moves nothing, so a fill written beside one of those still leaves the words on the line rather than half off it. Which pair that is is only known once the edge has been routed, which is why that one stays a build warning rather than joining the parse-time gate.

  `pad` and `side` on an edge, and `point` on a box, all resolve through `dgDefaultLayers`, explicitly. Every other geometric option is picked up by `pick()` inside `sizeOf`, and an edge never goes near `sizeOf` – so `default edge pad 0.2` would otherwise have parsed, landed in the model and moved nothing. `point` is the same sentence with two consumers instead of none: `sizeOf`, where `pick` is scoped to one call, and the print emitter, which is not in `sizeOf` at all – so `default box point up` parsed, was type-checked against `DG_WORD_OPTS` and aimed nothing. `dgPointOf()` answers it, with the element's own word winning. A defaulted direction landing on an element with no point is **not** an error, and that is `dgReadDefault`'s own rule rather than an exception to it: a default is legal where the kind can reach the word, and where this figure has not given it one the drawing is the author's business. Adding the option also made an older hole dangerous: only the token immediately before the arrow is read as an endpoint, so `edge pad 0.1 a -> b` parsed and dropped the number, and `edge w1 ext -- fw.left` had been dropping a token on twelve lines of `lectures/network-security` since they were written. **That slot is the edge's own name now** – see below – so exactly one token may sit between `edge` and the from-token, and a second is an error naming the run.
- **A vector asset is embedded once and referenced with `<use>`.** The first instance carries the `<symbol>`, so a file used once costs the wrapper and nothing more. **Only assets with neither a `<style>` block nor internal id references are shared** – a `<use>` instance is a shadow clone and `inlineSvg`'s `@scope` anchor does not reach into one, so sharing such a file would leave a drawing with no lines. Two traps cost a debugging session each: the symbol has to shed the root's `id`/`role`/`aria-label`, and `body` still carries the file's own `</svg>`, which inside a `<symbol>` closes the *diagram's* svg and drops everything after it into the `<figure>`.

- **A `bars … series of` line is the one statement that produces no element carrying its own name**, because it draws columns into a frame it does not own. The span table keys off `id === el.id`, so it had no entry at all and nothing on the line was editable – which looked like a decision and was an accident. `model.statements` holds one record per such statement and `createSpanTable` walks it; `spanOf` also gained generic support for **bare words** off `DG_BARE_OPTS`, so `stacked` is present-as-a-token or absent-as-an-insertion-point, which is a checkbox at the call site rather than two branches.

`lint.js` mirrors the parsing contract for all of this – including a `table`'s rows and its two tag families, a `lanes`'s bands and captions, a `sequence`'s three entry shapes with every name and tag they generate, a series that declares columns but no baseline and no ticks, and an `.elbow` that also carries `via` – and the generated names live in `dgBarName` / `dgTickName` / `dgBaseName` / `dgCellName` / `dgPlotName` / `dgRowTag` / `dgColTag` / `dgLaneName` / `dgLaneCapName` / `dgLifeName` / `dgMsgName` / `dgMsgNumName` / `dgMsgSubName` / `dgNoteName` / `dgMsgTag` / `dgMsgsTag` / `dgNotesTag` / `dgActorsTag` / `dgLivesTag`, imported by both files. One asymmetry is older than any of this and stays: neither file checks an *unknown option name* on one of the six statements that go through `readGridOpts`, because deciding it means re-implementing `readGridOpts` in the linter. The build names the line. That bends "tables only, never a function" – a naming scheme is a table, one indexed rather than listed, and the compiler and the linter have to agree on it exactly or every chart reports a dozen undefined references. **`rejectClassOn`, `rejectSlotPair`, `rejectHeadClassIn` and `dgTakes` ride the same bend for the same reason**: each one *is* a rule about the vocabulary – which class a kind can draw, which two classes answer one question, where a head class may be written, what a statement accepts – and a second spelling of any of them in lint.js is how the gate came to pass lines the build refuses. That matters because CI lints `lectures/network-security` and `lectures/diagrams` but never builds them, so such a line merged green and failed every later build.

Consequences of those three decisions (under *What the compiler is*), and the rules that grew beside them – worth not breaking:

- **Steps ride the existing reveal counter.** `chunkBeats(el)` walks the chunk in document order and returns the reveal segments after the first, plus one beat per diagram step. `revealed[chunkId]` stays the only state involved, so sync, the freeze gate, the backward-navigation rule ("a chunk *arrived at* from elsewhere shows fully revealed"), and localStorage recovery all keep working unchanged. `countSegments` now returns *positions* (beats + 1), which is the convention `jumpTo` and `advanceReveal` were already written against. **Stepping backwards costs nothing beyond the counter**: `applyReveal` recomputes every beat's state from `revealed[id]` on each call and `dgStep` renders any step in either direction, so `retreatReveal` is `advanceReveal` with the sign flipped. Reveal was forward-only in the *key map*, never in the mechanism – see PRD §4.6 and §5 for the two key families and the one column exception. Document order also gets the interleaving right: a diagram inside segment 1 only advances once segment 1 is up.
- **Visibility runs downhill: one rule, three faces – and it is the *default*, which an explicit `show` or `hide` overrides.** An edge is only as visible as its endpoints; a `container` / `brace` only as visible as its members, *and it fits the visible ones*; a `text` that grew a leader only as visible as what it points at. An arrow pointing at a box that has not appeared, an outline around nothing, or a note whose stub leads nowhere is never what the author meant, so most of a diagram needs no `show` of its own. All three resolve **together, as a fixed point, at the top of `dgFrameDrawables`**, and `record()` then reads that answer instead of `state.visible`; the container's fit is in `layoutDiagram` and falls back to all members when none is visible, because a zero-extent box would poison the viewBox.

  **The iteration is what makes the three faces one rule rather than three checks.** They used to be three reads of `state`, which carries what the *steps* said and nothing derived from it – so a face could not see another face's answer. The leader face therefore held only where the leader pointed at a node: `text why "…" -- leak`, whose subject is the *edge* `leak`, saw that edge's untouched `true` and stayed lit while the edge itself was dark for want of its endpoint. The tutorial's `#diagram-beats` opened with an annotation and a stub hanging in empty paper, on the slide that states the rule. A round can only ever turn visibility *off*, so the walk settles in at most one round per element and a reference cycle terminates instead of spinning. **Placement is deliberately not a fourth face**: that same annotation is placed `right of log`, and hiding whatever is placed against something hidden is a much larger rule than this one – placement is layout, and the closure is about what *hangs off* something.

  **`show edge-1` used to be a silent no-op**: it parsed, passed the reference check, wrote `state.visible` – and was then thrown away by the clamp above it. `dgStateAt` carries a `visExplicit` flag per element per beat now, set by any `show` or `hide` naming it (tags expand to members, as everywhere else), and every face of the closure in `dgFrameDrawables` plus the container fit in `layoutDiagram` all yield to it – including the fit, which then measures **all** members rather than the visible subset, because an outline the author showed by name drawn around part of what it holds is the same mistake read the other way. The flag is sticky within a beat's history and rebuilt from scratch for each beat, so it means "the author said so at or before beat *k*" and the opening beat, where nothing has been said, inherits exactly as before.
- **Print is the last beat – not the union – and its prominence is the opening beat's.** The union printed a `hide`n element on top of whatever replaced it; everything shown and never hidden is in the last beat anyway, so the two readings differ only where the author said `hide`, and there the last beat is the one that means "the finished picture". Tones, labels, geometry and visibility all come from the last beat. **Only the prominence slot comes from frame 0**, and the rule is one sentence readable off the source: *a prominence class on an element's own line is part of the drawing and appears in the handout; a prominence set inside a `step` is a lecture-time act and does not.*

  That replaces a `stepEmph` *provenance* flag – set by the verb, cleared by the class – which was the right intention implemented as something no reader could see. `emph a` and `style a {.emph}` were identical on screen and different on paper, with nothing in the source to say so; and the flag was recorded per **element** rather than per class, so any prominence verb naming an element stripped a `{.dim}` the author had written on the element's own line and never touched in a step – an element declared to be background came out of the printer as foreground. The new rule also stops being a second thing to learn, because `figure-design.md` already tells authors that emphasis a figure *opens* with belongs on the statement rather than in beat 1. Returning to normal at a later beat is `{!emph}`, not a fourth word. The static attributes in the emitted SVG *are* the print state, so a view with no JavaScript shows the finished picture rather than its opening beat.

  **An arrowhead the last beat removed is not drawn either.** The head node is still emitted whenever *any* frame carries one, because the live runtime needs it to exist so a later beat can bring it back – but it is pinned to `opacity: 0` in the print state, through the same inline channel `dgOpacity()` writes visibility through. Left as the union it printed the last beat's line with the opening beat's head: an arrowhead sitting on an endpoint that was never shortened to receive it, and in print there is no runtime to correct it. The same answer covers a stepped diagram inside an `::: expand`: its steps consume no beats (`chunkBeats` skips expansion bodies), so the live views show it at its last step too – where no beat can reach, the finished picture is the one to show. Print also strips every per-figure script payload (`stripDiagramPayloads`): frames, source and asset table are JSON for runtimes print does not ship, and they were 346 KB of the network-security print file.
- **Two viewBoxes, and the static one is print's.** Print wants the finished picture tight; a live view has to reserve room for every beat or an element walking in from outside is clipped for its whole journey. So the `viewBox` attribute is the print box and `data-live-viewbox` carries the union, which `initDiagrams` swaps in at boot (with `data-live-ratio` for the intrinsic height). Emitting the union statically printed a band of empty paper the height of wherever something started out.
- **Visibility and the two softening classes share one channel, so `dgOpacity()` resolves them together.** `.ghost` and `.dim` deliberately set no opacity in CSS: author CSS beats a presentation attribute, so an element pinned at 0.45 by the stylesheet could never be hidden and its `show` step did nothing. The emitter writes the resolved number as an inline style and the runtime sets `style.opacity`; both call the same function.
- **An element starts hidden only when the *first* thing a step says about it is `show`.** Treating every `show` target as initially hidden broke hide-then-show: an element meant to be on screen from the opening beat and taken away later started invisible.
- **The same word means the same thing in two statements.** `container … pad n` and `brace … pad n` are one concept – how far the outline sits from what it encloses – and the brace used to spell it `gap`, which everywhere else in the grammar is the distance between two *elements*. Likewise one coordinate grammar (`dgParsePair`) behind `at`, `move … to`, waypoints and endpoints, and one `via` keyword that is no longer optional. These are cheap to trade away one at a time and expensive in aggregate: every exception is a thing an author, an LLM and the editor each have to learn separately.

  **The converse costs the same, and four words were paying it.** One spelling for two constructs is as expensive as two spellings for one concept, and each of these could put both readings on one line:

  - **`align` on a placement is `flush`.** The *statement* keeps `align`, because that is what the set operation is called in every drawing tool anyone has used; the placement option – which cross-axis edge of the reference the new element lines up with – is the one that moves. `flush` is the word the prose already reached for when it explained the option, and it is a poor name for the statement ("flush these five boxes" is not English), so the two cannot swap back by accident. A written `align` inside a placement is named in the refusal rather than left to the generated vocabulary sentence: it is exactly what an author who learned the old spelling will type.
  - **The centre word is `middle` on both axes.** `align x center` and `align y middle` were the same act spelled two ways, and `align x middle` was refused although nothing about it is ambiguous. `center` stays in `DG_ANCHORS` – `q.center` is a different grammatical slot and the direct name for the centre of one element.
  - **A `plot`'s tick interval is `tick`, not `step`.** `step` is the statement that opens a beat, so a reader scanning a block for its beats had to know that a `step` mid-line on a `plot` was not one. Of the three pairs this revision unpicked it was the worst, because the two roles are not two parts of speech but a *statement* and an *option*. `tick` and not `ticks`, because the value is an interval rather than a count.
  - **A brace's side is `side <word>`, and so is an edge label's.** It was the last bare positional option in the statement grammar – a lone `left` among keyed options, whose place on the line was free – and it is one concept with the edge's: which side of the thing the label or the spine sits on.
- **`default <kind>` accepts exactly the options that kind's own statement accepts** (`DG_KIND_OPTS`). `default box r 5` used to parse and then do nothing, which is a silent no-op. The error names which kind the option belongs to. `w`, `h`, `r` and `point` are gated on the same table wherever they are written, so a `dot` given a `w` or a `text` given an `r` is refused by the sentence that lists what the statement does take rather than by a check written per option.
- **The four `.tone-N` classes are one hue at four strengths, so they cannot encode an ordered scale.** low/medium/high written `.tone-2` / `.tone-3` / `.tone-4` renders as two greys and a red: two of the three do not separate at a projector's brightness, and whatever convention the audience already had for that scale – traffic lights, most obviously – has been thrown away for one that has to be learned from the figure. Distinct hues beat distinct lightness. A scale wants shape or position; tone is for saying which of two kinds a thing is.

- **`style` displaces same-slot classes, like the `default` block.** Adding `.tone-1` alongside an existing `.tone-4` left both matching at equal specificity, so stylesheet order decided the colour and the step could silently do nothing. A `style` with an empty tail, or none at all, is an **error**: `style a {}` and `style a` were both accepted and both did nothing, and that is precisely the shape an author reaches for when what they wanted was a removal.
- **`{!class}` takes a class off, in an element's tail, a `default` tail and a `style` step.** A step could only ever *add* one, and many slots express their base state as the absence of every member – normal prominence, a solid stroke, regular size and family – so a beat could leave that state and never return, and an element could not opt out of a `default box {.dim}` on its own line either. One mark closes both, where a named neutral per slot would have been a word per look. It removes the **exact name**, not the slot: `!dim` does not clear `.ghost`, and a later layer may add `.dim` back – which is what keeps the mark predictable without inventing a second, hidden slot grammar. Layers resolve weak to strong and removals run before additions within a layer, so `{.c !c}` in one tail is an error (there is no order under which the removal is not dead) while `style e {!dashed}` at beat 2 and `style e {.dashed}` at beat 4 compose the way an author reads them. The figures that need it were found by other checks rather than written to demonstrate it, which is the evidence that matters: `#beats-demo` cannot say what it means without `{.dim}` on the element's own line plus `style r {!dim}` for the beats where it does not apply, and the two `lectures/network-security` DDoS figures need `{.tone-4 !accent}` to drop a block-level `default box {.accent}` that was landing invisibly under an inverting fill – a clash the check only sees once it resolves the default layer down onto the element.
- **Prominence is one channel with three names used identically in three positions**: a class (`{.dim}`), a step verb (`dim a, b`) and a `bars` option taking column indices (`dim 0,2`). `DG_PROMINENCE` is the single table behind all three, spliced into `DG_STEP_OPS`, `DG_LIST_OPTS` and `DG_CLASS_GROUPS`, so learning one position teaches the other two. It replaced `calm`, a verb that existed nowhere else in the grammar, had no class behind it and was not derivable from anything a reader had already learned – and `.ghost`, which had no verb at all, so a beat could reach it only through `style`. `dim a` and `style a {.dim}` are the same act, byte-identical through the print pass included; returning to the unnamed normal is `{!emph}` / `{!dim}` / `{!ghost}`, not a fourth word.

  **That sentence was a claim before it was true, and two things had to change to make it one.** The verb was not gated at all while the class was, so `.emph` on a free `text` was refused and `emph a` on the same text was accepted and drew nothing – the silent no-op this grammar refuses, reachable through exactly one of two spellings the docs called identical. And `emph` carried a *narrower kind list* than `dim` and `ghost`, which was never a decision: it was the stylesheet's reach mistaken for the grammar's. `.emph` fills glyphs with `--emph` now, exactly as `.accent` on the same channel already did, so a text draws it; an image draws no ink either way and **still acts**, because the three displace each other in one slot, so `emph` on a dimmed image is what undims it. One list for all three, off `DG_PROMINENCE`.

  Narrowing the verb instead was tried first and is the wrong repair, for a reason worth keeping: **the sets this would have refused are sets the compiler built, not sets an author chose.** `@wa-msg-N` is generated by `sequence` and documented as the way to address one message, and it holds the arrow *and* its number *and* its second line; a `{@tp}` written once on a `grid` line is spread by the expansion over the frame and every image cell it draws. Under "one bad member fails the statement" both become unusable, and the confusion-matrix figure in `lectures/network-security` – whose whole argument is `emph @tp` against `dim @fn, @wellneg, @fpos` – cannot be written at all. The rule is right for a hand-written tag and wrong the moment the compiler is the one doing the mixing.

  **Emphasis acts on whatever the element actually draws, and a `.bare` element draws no outline.** `emph` is an accent stroke on a shape and accent ink on a text, and on a cell that has just taken its outline off with `.bare` the stroke came *back* – the two classes are in two slots, the stylesheet wrote them at one specificity, and source order handed it to `.emph`. What the room then saw was not emphasis but a form: `#vorgang` lit three cells of a `{.bare .clear}` table and got three red rectangles, one of them empty and 566 px wide; `#zweimal` got two red boxes round one word each; the `#bauplan` figures got red dashed empty cells. So on a `.bare` element `emph` emphasises the **ink** – the accent fill and the weight `.emph text` already gives a free text – and draws no outline. That is the same correction `DG_BAR_FILLS` makes one channel along, where `emph` on a column is a solid accent fill rather than the accent outline it is on every other shape, and it is why neither of those is a special case: emphasis has to act on the thing the element has. It is one stylesheet rule (`.psi-diagram .bare.emph`, three classes, written after `.tone-4.emph` so it wins the tie), so the static class and the step verb are one act, and `test/gates/semantics.mjs` holds both halves – the compiler keeps both classes on the element, and the rule that decides what the pair means is where it has to be in source order. Existing decks change only where `emph` meets `.bare`, which in the measured corpus is tables, where it was a defect.

  The gate itself stays, and it runs on the verb through the same deferred walk as `style` (`model.byId` after the block, because a step may name an element declared below it). What it needed was **`DG_CLASS_KIND_SET`, the kinds `DG_CLASS_KINDS` describes at all, derived from it rather than listed.** A `bars`, `grid` or `plot` *frame* is none of them – the table has nothing to say about a frame – so a gate walking resolved kinds refused on one every class the same figure may write one line up: `style f {.dim}` was refused while `bars f "3,4" {.dim}` compiled. `lint.js` had been carrying a hand-written copy of that list to avoid the same thing; it imports the derived one now, so the two cannot drift.
- **Two gates hold the prominence contract, and which one holds what is the rule to copy.** The kind list is one list for all three words, so `.emph` on a free text is legal and `emph @wa-msg-N` reaches a set the compiler mixed – both are *emitted state*, and `test/gates/semantics.mjs` reads them out of the frames in milliseconds. What a class then *means* on a text is one stylesheet rule and nothing else: the compiler emits the same class whether or not `.psi-diagram .emph text { fill: var(--emph) }` exists. Measured, not assumed – deleting that rule left all 389 fast gates green, which is the same failure the grammar keeps closing (a word that resolves, emits its CSS and moves nothing) arriving one layer down, in the tests. `test/figure-prominence.mjs` is the browser half, and it asserts a *difference* rather than a hue, because the token moves with all seven themes. **Pick the gate by the failure mode: frames for what the compiler decided, computed style for what the stylesheet means.**
- **`move @tag to …` is an error, `move @tag by …` is not.** Every other step op expands a tag to its members and does the same thing to each; `to` would give them all one placement and stack the set on a point. The build says so and names `by`.
- **`align` / `spread` only work on nodes**, because they override a coordinate the node branch of the walk computes. Naming a container, brace or edge is an error rather than a line that quietly does nothing.
- **A label is marked up by four characters, and `\` writes any of them literally.** `_sub` and `^sup` shift the next character or a `{group}`; `*accent*` colours a run and `~muted~` greys it. `\_`, `\^`, `\*`, `\~` and `\\` each draw the bare character – which is how a label forces the bare character where the rule below would shift it – `MAX\_N`, where the `N` ends the word, or `a\_b`. `scan_page` and `MAX_RETRIES` need no escape: a marker in the middle of a word is already drawn as typed. **A marker that cannot do its job is a literal character, and all four markers now have that fallback.** `*` and `~` cannot do it when nothing later in the label closes them. `_` and `^` cannot do it when the single character they take would leave the rest of the word behind at full size, so **a shift marker in the middle of a word is drawn as typed** (`DG_LABEL_WORD`, where `_` itself counts as a word character so that `snake_case_name` stays literal all the way along). `hausarbeit_final.pdf` on a real keynote came out as `hausarbeit`, a subscript `f` and `inal.pdf`, which the room read as `hausarbeit,inal.pdf` – silently, with a clean lint, and with `dgMeasure` sizing the box to fit exactly the wrong reading. The line the rule draws is the one the corpus already sits on: `m_1`, `c_0`, `MAC_k(M)` and `M_F,` all shift, because the character taken ends the word, while every filename and identifier does not. A shift of more than one character was always `_{ab}`, and a group shifts wherever it is written, so the rule costs no reachable spelling; `a\_b` remains the way to force a literal in the one-character case. The escape covers all four and itself rather than only the two that need it: an escape with an exception in it is the next thing to remember. **It is resolved in `dgSpans`, which is the one function both `dgMeasure` and the emitter read a label through**, so the backslash reaches neither the estimate nor the drawing – handled at the emitter instead it would widen every box carrying one by a whole character. `test/gates/semantics.mjs` asserts both signs of all four markers, that the escape costs no width, and that `dgTokenize` still breaks a line at `\n`.
- **Two layers touch a backslash, and only one of them decodes.** `dgTokenize` reads the quoted string and owns exactly two sequences, because they are about the token rather than about the words in it: `\n` is a line break and `\"` is a quote that does not end the string. Every other backslash is passed on whole for `dgSpans` to resolve, `\\` included. It used to drop every backslash it did not recognise, which is what made `\_` unreachable – the marker escape was written against `dgSpans` alone and the tokenizer ate it one layer earlier – and which also drew `C:\tmp` as `C:tmp`. `dgeQuote` in `editor.mjs` is the inverse and has to stay the inverse: it re-encodes a quote and a line break and leaves a backslash alone, because the value the panel edits is the text `dgSpans` reads.
- **Label changes are pre-rendered variants, not text surgery.** A `label` step toggles between `<g>`s that were typeset at build time, which keeps every trace of typesetting out of the runtime.
- **A label's extent has to describe what the emitter will draw, and every place that positions one has to measure it.** These are two halves of the same rule and both were broken, which is why figures sat off-centre inside oversized frames. `extentsOf` reserved a box of `lw * 2` centred on the label's origin – a full label width on *each* side – so a figure whose outermost element was a caption reserved half that caption's width of paper beyond it; and only `labelBox` recorded a measured width at all, so container captions, brace labels and edge labels fell through to a hardcoded `[120, 28]` regardless of their text. Measured on `lectures/diagrams` before the fix: up to 122px of empty margin on one side of a 480px figure. `anchorFor` now answers the anchor question exactly the way `dgTextEl` does, and **the print pass has to be handed `printCls`** – a pass with no classes silently treats every label as centred, which under-reserves a `.right` one by half its width and clips it off the paper. `test/figure-framing.mjs` measures the slack on all four sides of every figure and is the guard: this is invisible in every other check, because the picture is still correct, it just is not centred.
- **`dgLabelAnchor()` is the one answer to which side of its origin a label sits on.** The emitter asks it to write `text-anchor`, and `extentsOf` asks it to reserve the paper – and a label reserved on the side it is not drawn on is how figures came to sit off-centre in oversized frames. It was two copies of the same question until the alignment classes made it three. A `.turn`ed label is centred whichever way it reads, so the across-words have nothing to say about it, and that exception lives in the one function too.
- **Label alignment is measured against the element's own padding, and it moves the *block*, not the line.** `.left` / `.right` place a horizontal run of text, `.top` / `.bottom` the block of lines, and both mean "as far that way as this box allows" – its inner edge, not its border. Because the origin stays the centre of the block and only that centre moves, a bottom-aligned label of three lines puts its **last** line on the inner edge rather than its first, and the recorded extent stays symmetric about the origin so nothing downstream has to know. `.left` / `.right` used to be free-`text`-only, and on a box they were a latent bug: the label was anchored at the box centre and ran out of it. `lectures/diagrams` `#justify` is the reference for all nine combinations.

  **Where one of those four words cannot act it is an error, not a no-op**, and it is the general class gate that says so rather than a check of their own. Three kinds place their label by their own statement rather than through `labelBox`: a container's caption sits on its own top border, a brace's beside the spine on the side the brace was given, an edge's at the middle of the line. So the four apply to a `box`, a `dot` and a free `text`, and `DG_CLASS_KINDS` says exactly that. **On an edge they used to name which side of the line the label sits on, and that reading is the `side` option now** – one keyed word instead of four classes that mean two different geometries depending on the kind they sit on. **Which pair of words can act is a question about the beats the edge is on screen**, and `dgEdgeSideWarnings` is where it is asked: only the pair lying across the routed line can move the label, so naming the other pair is a warning – but the check used to sit in `dgFrameDrawables`, which runs for every beat whether the edge is drawn in it or not, and an arrow revealed by the very step that levels its two ends was therefore judged on a base geometry nobody sees it in (the tutorial's `#diagram-steps`: the step that shows the two arrows to Bob is the step that moves Eve onto their line). It is a post-pass now, over the beats at which the edge is visible and carries a label; an edge that genuinely changes axis while visible is warned about **by beat**, because there the word acts on one press and not on the next. The per-beat geometry did not move – a side that cannot act at a beat still moves nothing at that beat – only the sentence about it. `lint.js` mirrors none of this and cannot: it does not lay a figure out. Two things the placement still has to get right: the offset must clear whatever the label measures **along the normal** (its height beside a horizontal line, its width beside a vertical one, and the other way round again when turned), and the anchor is forced to `middle`, because `dgLabelAnchor` would otherwise read a `.left` and shift the text back across the line it had just cleared. The normal is oriented in page terms rather than travel terms, or a right-to-left arrow puts its label below while every left-to-right one puts it above. **`dgTurnOf()` answers in degrees, so the boolean that measurement needs has to be derived rather than assumed**: the comparison was written `vertical !== dgTurnOf(...)`, which is `false !== 0` – true whatever the line does – so every edge label cleared its own *width*, and on a horizontal edge that pushed the words off by half the label's length. That is why two arrows between one pair carried their labels at two different heights, each proportional to how long its own word was. `turnDeg` (the number, which rides as the third component of the label's geometry vector) and `turned` (the boolean, for the comparison) are separate now. Measured on the emitted SVG before any of this existed, `.left` moved a node label and an edge label and nothing else, and `.top` moved a node label alone; the other five combinations resolved, emitted their CSS and moved nothing. `test/figure-labels.mjs` asserts both halves – the ones refused and the ones that act – and the editor's swatch rows carry exactly the kinds the compiler allows, so the panel never offers a click that can only be refused.
- **`at X,Y` names a point, and `anchor` says which point of the element lands on it.** Nine words, and they are `DG_ANCHORS` – `tl` / `top` / `tr` / `left` / `center` / `right` / `bl` / `bottom` / `br`, the same set an edge endpoint spells, because a ninth-of-a-box is one idea whichever end of a line or which corner of a label it names. The default is `center`, so a deck that writes no anchor builds byte-identically; `anchor center` is the default written out and draws what leaving the word off draws. **It is an option of the *placement expression*, not of the statement** (`DG_PLACE_OPTS`, with `gap`, `flush`, `frac` and `offset`), which has two consequences worth knowing: it goes directly after the placement, before `w` / `h` / `pad` and before the `{…}` tail – written after them the expression has already ended and nothing reads it, which `dgUnexpected` now names rather than listing the statement's own vocabulary at an author who did not ask for it – and it is refused on a relative placement, which states a face of another element rather than a coordinate and answers the same question with `flush`. Every statement that takes a placement takes it, `table` and `lanes` included, because it lives on the placement rather than in `DG_KIND_OPTS`. **`move … to` carries it forward**: `anchor` says how an element meets a coordinate and a step says which coordinate, so a step that answered both would silently re-centre an anchored element by half its own size the first time it moved. The arithmetic is `dgAnchorOffset`, applied in `layoutDiagram` beside the offset because it is the one placement option that needs the element's own size.

  **What it is for is the element that has to meet a coordinate by a corner no class names**: `anchor tl` for a caption hung inside a frame's corner, `anchor bottom` for a note standing on a point. A free `text`'s `.left` and `.right` at an absolute placement are anchors of their own (`dgPlaceAnchor`, the fifth placement trap), so a row of `.left` labels sharing one x lines up without the word, and `anchor center` is how such a label asks for the centring back – which is why `anchor center` is recorded rather than dropped as the default.
- **Text width is estimated, not measured.** There is no browser at build time, so `dgMeasure` uses a per-character advance table, tuned slightly generous (a box wider than its text reads as designed; narrower reads as broken). An explicit `w` that cannot hold its own label emits a `[diagram]` warning rather than overflowing in silence.
- **Every length in the layout is in grid units, and there are two families of them.** A number that **addresses** the grid is axis-keyed, because a cell has a width and a height: `at`, `w`, `h`, `offset`, a waypoint and every nudge are addresses, and they take `uw` across and `uh` down. A number that states a **clearance** is square, and its ruler is one row – `uh` on both axes.

  `gap` was the one clearance that was not. Multiplied by the cell's width across and its height down, the same number on two adjacent lines drew two distances with nothing in the source to say so; measured over the corpus, `gap 1` across was on median **2.9 times** `gap 1` down. That silently breaks the first rule the artifact page teaches – even gaps say nothing, uneven gaps mean something – and it is why `bars … space` and `table … space` were square-ified in the same pass: on a `150x52` grid a `space` meant 30.0px between two columns and 10.4px between two rows, and adding the word `horizontal` to a `bars` line rescaled its column spacing with nothing between the two words to suggest a connection.

  `uh` and not `uw`, the mean, or a new unit, for three reasons that were already true: `pad` on a box, text, container, brace and edge, `cell` and `space` on a `grid`, `DG_DOT_R`, `DG_LEAD_GAP` and the four `sequence` rhythm constants are every one of them measured against `uh` today, so `gap` was the outlier rather than the rule; `uw` would contradict `pad`, the word an author reaches for on the next line; and a dedicated unit adds a fence word nobody would set, when the author already writes `::: draw 150x52` and the clearance ruler is its second number, visible in the source. The migration wrote the converted number out at every horizontal placement, including the six in the corpus that had relied on the unwritten default – a placement that silently depends on a default it never chose is the same defect one layer down.

  **The `gap` an author does not write is the one number that is not in rows, and that is the point.** A row is whatever the opener says – 20 px on `20x20`, 40 on `120x40`, 72 on the default grid – so the old default of `0.25` rows drew a 5 px clearance on one figure and an 18 px one on another, and on the grid a measured keynote used it came out at 10 px against a 9 px arrowhead: a head with no shaft. Nobody chose any of those numbers. The default is stated in the one ruler a drawing carries whatever its opener says, the height of a base label (`DG_LABEL_H`, `DG_FONT × DG_LINE_H` = 18.75 px): **`DG_GAP_PLAIN`, one label, for a pair nothing joins, and `DG_GAP_JOINED`, 1.6 of them, for a pair an `edge` joins** – 30 px, the 9 px head plus as much shaft again. Which of the two applies is decided by `dgResolveAutoGaps` once the whole block has been read, off the same edge list the dependency walk is built from, because no single line knows whether an arrow will arrive later. Where that edge carries a **label**, the default widens again to hold the words plus two paddings, but only across – a label on a vertical run stands beside the line and costs the gap nothing.

  **A written `gap` keeps its meaning and its unit: it stays a number of rows.** Two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one. It is the unit every other clearance in this grammar is in, so `gap 0.4` and `pad 0.4` stay comparable on the line an author writes them on; and it is a number the author tuned by eye against the grid in the opener, which other elements are chained off – re-reading it in labels would move every figure in every deck that has one, silently, in a direction nobody asked for. So `place.gap` is a count of rows and `place.gapAuto` a count of labels, two fields rather than one, and `dgGapPx` is the single place the two units are spent. The editor reads it through `dgeGapOf`, for the same reason: a drag that added its delta to the raw field got `NaN` on exactly the placements the new default is for.

  **`lh` is how an author says "label heights", and it is the ruler the rules are written in.** `gap 1.5lh`, `pad 0.6lh`, `row a, b gap 2lh`, `default box pad 0.5lh`. A bare number stays a count of grid rows, so nothing an existing deck says moves; the suffix is for the other case, which had no spelling at all. The default gap has been a count of label heights since it stopped being 0.25 rows, and `figure-design.md` states every spacing rule in labels – but the numbers an author could write were rows, so a figure that spaced correctly on a `150x52` grid had to be re-derived on a `20x20` one, and the same `0.4` meant four distances across four figures of one deck. `dgLen` reads the suffix, `dgGapPx` spends it for a gap and `dgUnitPx` for everything else, so there are still exactly two functions where a unit becomes pixels. **An `lh` gap is a gap the author wrote**, so `dgResolveAutoGaps` leaves it alone and no edge widens it, the same contract a bare number has. Where it earns most is a `default` layer: `draw-defaults` is read once for a deck and applied to blocks whose openers differ, so a `pad` in rows there is a different distance in every figure and a `pad` in labels is one distance. `w`, `h` and `r` deliberately take no suffix – those are an element's *size*, and a size is stated against the grid, while a gap and a pad are clearances round type. Not mirrored in `lint.js` and not needing to be: neither file's tail walk reads a `gap` or a `pad` value, both skip the token. **The editor keeps the unit, because it is part of the span.** A drag, a re-dock, a `side` swatch, the `of` field, the dock chip and a step's `move … to` all spell a gap through `dgeGapSpelled` / `dgeGapWritten` in `editor.mjs`: the arithmetic stays in rows, where every guide and delta already works, and a line that wrote `5lh` gets `5.65lh` back, snapped on that ruler. Before, a drag wrote rows – right distance, wrong ruler – and the swatches wrote the label-height count back as rows, which moved the box. A gap nobody wrote has no unit to keep and is written in rows; the sibling-gap guide writes the sibling's own spelling, because the promise is the *same* gap. `pad` is not editable from the editor.

  **The arrowhead is `DG_HEAD`, 9 px, and it is what a gap has to pay for first.** It is drawn 9 px long with its tip on the target's face, and the shaft is trimmed back by `DG_HEAD * 0.85` (7.65 px) so the stroke stops just inside the head rather than showing through its point – which is why a clearance under about 9 px is an arrow a room sees the head of and not the shaft, and why the joined-pair default is `DG_GAP_JOINED` (1.6 labels, 30 px: the head plus as much shaft again). In the unit above the head is 0.48lh, so `gap 1lh` leaves about half a label of visible shaft and `gap 0.5lh` leaves none. What a written gap too short for its arrow costs is the sixth placement trap at the head of this file.

  **The `pad` an author does not write is in the label's own type, and that is the same sentence read the other way round.** A gap is a clearance between two elements and is in rows; a padding is the ring of paper between a label and its own outline, and what makes that ring look right is the size of the letters standing in it. `DG_PAD_X` / `DG_PAD_Y` (13 and 9 px) are scaled by `dgFontFor(classes) / DG_FONT` in `dgPadPx`, which is the construction `DG_ROW_H` already uses for a table row: a label carrying no size class gives a factor of exactly 1, so every existing drawing is byte-identical, and a `.large` box stops sitting tight in a base label's padding while a `.small` one stops floating in more air than its letters are tall. It reaches a `.large` table, whose cells are boxes like any other, and the ground round a `.small` `edge` label, which is the same ring one statement along. **A written `pad N` is not scaled**: it is a number in grid units, and a number in grid units is a statement about the grid – scaling it would make one number mean two distances depending on a class on the same line. The class-derived font is what `dgPadPx` is handed and not the fitted one, because `.fit` solves the type against a box whose padding is already settled. Corpus cost, measured: two `.small .paper` free texts in `lectures/diagrams#anchors`, whose grounds came in by a fifth; every other tracked view is the same bytes.

  `DG_DOT_R` was the older exception of the same shape – `13` raw pixels behind an author-facing `r` that is in grid units – so it was the one number that did not follow the block's `unit=`, and the smaller an author's unit the fatter a bare dot came out relative to everything around it: a plot marker arrived taller than the cell it marked a point in. It is `0.18` grid units now, and `0.18 * 72 = 12.96`, so the default unit is unchanged to the pixel. If a new constant is a distance, write it in grid units and multiply by `uh` at the point of use.
- **A name that exists but is not usable yet must not be reported as a name that does not exist.** Two messages said the second when they meant the first, and both came out as nonsense an author could not act on. `claim()` records a kind from the statement's first word, so a `plot` line that then failed on a later option is *registered* as a plot and never *declared* as one - and `dgResolvePlotCoords` duly reported that *"q is a plot, not a plot"*. It now names the third case and points at the line that carries the real error, and it says it once per name rather than once per coordinate, because eight identical complaints bury the one that explains them.
- **An element id may not shadow `Object.prototype`** (`DG_RESERVED_IDS`, a computed table, mirrored by lint.js): the live runtime keys plain objects by element id – a frame's `vis`/`cls`/`geom` straight from JSON, the target cache – so `constructor` or `__proto__` would read a prototype member where the runtime expects its own entry, and the failure surfaced at step time in the browser with nothing at build time to say why. Refused at parse instead.
- **`.hand` is the serif in italic**, because no handwriting face is bundled and adding one would cost payload in every output.
- **A vector image is spliced as a nested `<svg>`, not referenced through `<image href="data:…">`**, for the same reason `inlineSvg()` exists at all: an `<image>` lives in an isolated document context and inherits none of the page's custom properties. One trap there: the root id `inlineSvg` assigns is also the anchor of the `@scope (svg#…)` wrapper it puts around every `<style>` block, so overwriting the attribute alone silently kills the whole stylesheet – a line drawing arrives with no lines. Rename the token everywhere instead. Rasters are `data:` URIs and deliberately do not follow the theme.
- **A placement's `offset` lands before `align` / `spread` override the result, and a step's `move … by` after.** The offset is part of the placement expression, so an element written as `between a,b offset 0,1.35` and then aligned would otherwise get the offset twice – once through its own placement and once on top of the master's coordinate.
- **A label placed beside something has to be drawn away from it.** Container captions sit at the left border and brace labels beside the spine; both were anchored `middle` at first and lay half across what they belong to. `labelAnchor` carries the exception from the layout to the emitter. **The vertical is the same question and it was answered only for one line.** A label block is drawn centred on its origin (`dgTextEl` walks its baselines down from `-h/2`), and a brace's origin is a fixed 9 px clear of the tick end – so a *two*-line label on `side bottom` hung half its own height back up and printed its first line across the bar, with no escape in the source, because `pad` moves the brace and carries the label with it. **The two ends hang from the edge that faces the bar**: the first line of a `bottom` label sits where a one-line label sat and the rest grow downwards, the last line of a `top` label does the same and the rest grow upwards. The shift is the block's height less that one line's, so a one-line label is unmoved by construction and every one in the corpus is byte-identical. `left` and `right` keep the centring – there the label runs away from the bar along its own anchor, so every line is clear already – and so does a `.turn`ed label, which reads across the bar rather than towards it and is reserved as centred on both axes. Guarded in `test/gates/semantics.mjs`. A leader stub is the third case and was the last one fixed: every other edge leaves a box with a border, so a stroke ending on that border reads as attached, but a free `text` is a run of glyphs and the line arrived touching the letters. `DG_LEAD_GAP` (grid units, like every other distance) inflates the box the stub *leaves* rather than shortening the finished line, so the standoff is right whichever side `dgAutoAnchor` picks – and it is applied at the text end only, because the pointing end has to keep meeting its target exactly.
- **A coordinate may be another element's coordinate, and an edge is now one of them.** `via iv.cx,x0.cy` costs no dependency edge on the edge's own side, because edges are drawn after every box is placed. What changed is the other direction: **an edge has a box in `layoutDiagram` now**, so `text n "…" above w1 gap 0.2` and `at w1.cx,w1.cy` resolve. Until then a coordinate could name a box, a dot, a text or an image and never an edge – not by design but because edges were routed after the walk that places everything else, and the omission was load-bearing in the wrong direction: a label describing a wire had to be pinned to one of the *boxes* instead, and it then kept its distance from the box and lost it from the line the moment a fraction or a height changed. Measured on the page's own three-message exchange: raising the two boxes from `h 3.0` to `h 4.2` left a wire-anchored label at 13.5px from its line and dragged a box-anchored one out to 22.3px.

  Two things make it cheap and both must stay. **`dgEdgeRoute()` is the one text that works out a route** – anchor selection, the fraction along a side, the elbow rail – and both `layoutDiagram` and `dgFrameDrawables` call it; a second copy is the kind that drifts silently, one half still agreeing with the drawing while the other places notes a few pixels off. And an edge's dependencies are exactly its two ends plus every reference in its waypoints, all of which are already in the walk, so edges join the existing topological sort rather than getting a pass of their own – which is also why a genuine circle (`box b above w1` where `w1` ends at `b`) comes out as `placement cycle: b → w1 → b` naming the line.
- **`align` / `spread` are dependency edges plus a coordinate override, not constraints.** The first element listed is the master; the rest take one coordinate from it inside the same topological walk. That keeps the DAG a DAG – and a genuinely circular authoring (an element distributed by `spread` that an endpoint is also placed against) comes out as `placement cycle: …` naming the line.
- **An element's name goes in front, and `{#id}` is gone.** On a box, dot, text, image, container, brace or a chart the name is the word after the statement, and it always was. The tail form existed for the two constructs with no name slot – `edge` and, later, a `sequence` message – and it put the name **last, after the options**, where neither a reader nor a language model looks for it; worse, on every statement that did not honour it the id parsed, validated as a legal tail and was thrown away without a word, so `box a "A" {#zz}` followed by `text t "n" right of zz` reported that `zz` was not defined – a message about the reference for a defect in the definition. **An `edge` and a message take an optional name in the slot before the from-token**: `edge wire p -> q`. It is unambiguous by counting rather than by lookahead, because every endpoint form is exactly one token (`p`, `p.top`, `p.right:0.3`, `0,0` alike), and the slot was free, because two tokens before the arrow used to be a hard error – only the arity of that error moved. Anonymous stays exactly as short as it was; a mandatory placeholder was declined because 177 of 264 edges in the corpus and every one of its messages are anonymous. The one misreading the design could introduce is refused rather than guessed at: in `edge a b -> c`, if `a` already names an element then the line has two element names before its arrow, and the build says exactly that.

  `model.byId` is also what tells a *named* edge from an anonymous one, and the distinction matters because an anonymous `edge-3` is **positional** – insert an edge above it and the name silently moves to a different line. That was harmless while nothing could refer to an edge, and stopped being harmless when an edge became something a coordinate can name, so anything that offers to write `at edge-3.cy` has to know which it is looking at.
- **A `step` takes one name, matching `DG_STEP_NAME`** – the same identifier rule `claim()` applies to an element, exported so the editor's rename field imports it rather than paraphrasing it. A second token after the name is an error naming what a step is. The rule is ASCII, which is a real cost stated rather than hidden: a lecture cannot label a beat in a language that needs a diacritic. It is the same cost element names already carry, and the alternative was a naming layer that disagreed with itself – widening it would also have broken the editor's rename silently, because `dgeRenameIn` builds its word-boundary test with no `u` flag and would split a Unicode name mid-token.
- **A problem carries a phase, and problems sort by phase – never by line.** `DG_PHASES` is `syntax`, `reference`, `semantic`, `layout`, in causal order. A syntax failure can *manufacture* a dangling reference – `above of a` binds `of` as a name, a container's member scan swallows a mistyped option, an `edge` with nothing before its arrow reads the keyword as an endpoint – and the reverse never happens, because a name that is merely absent cannot break a line's shape. So the cause is always in the earlier phase, and reporting in that order is a statement about causality rather than a preference; a line number is not evidence about cause, and sorting by it puts the manufactured symptom first whenever the statement that manufactured it sits further down the block. Within a phase the sort is stable, so push order survives, and push order already means "the parser met this one first". **This matters far more to the editor than to a terminal**: `dgeSetSource` rolls a refused edit back and shows `problems[0]` and nothing else, so whichever problem lands first *is* the whole message a panel user gets.

  The counterpart is that a statement which stopped reading early does not then earn a complaint per remaining token plus one for the placement it never got to. `dgParsePlacement` returns a third state – *attempted and failed*, as distinct from *there is no placement here, try the next branch* – and the node loop sets its own `stopped` flag from that or from an unreadable token. Measured on the same examples: `rightof a` went from five problems to one, `above of a` from four to one, and the two cases that must not change – a genuinely missing placement, and two real independent errors on one line – stayed where they were.
- **Tags replaced `group`.** `@tag` in the attribute tail, addressable wherever a name is. The reason is locality rather than expressiveness: adding an element to a `group` meant editing a line elsewhere in the file, which is the edit both a language model and a diff handle worst. `model.tags` is built after parsing, so a tag may be referenced before the element carrying it is declared.
- **The skew warning is the counterpart to the too-narrow-box warning.** A line 2° off an axis is almost never intent; it is two endpoints that were meant to line up. `DG_SKEW_DEG` is the threshold, and anything genuinely diagonal is far outside it. There is deliberately no warning for edges that cross or that terminate at the same point: fan-in to one anchor is common and legitimate, so that check would fire on correct diagrams.
- **Defaults resolve in four layers, most specific last:** the lecture's `default <kind>`, the lecture's `default <kind> @tag`, the block's `default <kind>`, the block's `default <kind> @tag`, then the element's own attributes. `dgDefaultLayers()` is the one place that order is written down. **`withDefaults` walks it weak to strong**: at each layer the removals delete those exact names from what has accumulated, then each positive class displaces the current member of its slot and is added. That is what makes `{.tone-1}` beat `default box {.tone-4}` and a tag default beat the bare kind. It used to walk most-specific-*first* and skip a class whose slot was already claimed, which gives the same answer for positives alone – but it has no place to put a removal, because at the moment a `!dim` is read the `.dim` it cancels has not been added yet. **One text resolves a stack of layers, and it is `dgComposeClassLayers()`.** `withDefaults` is two lines calling it, and so is the `sequence` composing its statement tail with an actor entry's own – which had been a second implementation that concatenated both layers' positives into one list and both layers' removals into another. That erases the ordering *before* the resolver sees it, so every removal ran before every positive and a strong `actor a "A" {!dim}` was undone by the weak `sequence s {.dim}` above it, while the opposite direction worked. It returns both halves: the surviving classes and the removals that survive the whole stack, because a composed element has to carry its removal on to a weaker layer nobody in that stack has seen – a `default box {.dim}` under it.

  **Resolution order and emission order are two different questions**: the walk records which layer each surviving class came from and emits strongest-first, which is the order the `class` attribute always had. Nothing reads that order – CSS arbitrates by selector, not by position – so the emitter has no business changing it as a side effect of a fix somewhere else, and keeping it stable is what lets a corpus snapshot stay a usable signal. **Scope before selector**: a block that says `default box {.tone-4}` means it, even for an element the lecture tags `@dec`.
- **The lecture-wide layer is the `draw-defaults` frontmatter key**, holding `default` statements in the same language (`parseDiagramDefaults`). `parseLecture` already has the frontmatter in hand where `renderDiagram` is invoked, so nothing is threaded through `buildOnce`. Two rules there differ from a block's: anything but a `default` statement in the key is an error naming the line **even when no diagram uses it**, and a `default <kind> @tag` has to be used *somewhere in the lecture* rather than in one block – which is why `dgLectureTags` accumulates while the blocks compile and `parseLecture` rules on it at the end. `lint.js` mirrors both with `collectDiagramDefaults()`, fifteen lines of indentation-scanning rather than a YAML parser.
- **`DG_CLASS_GROUPS` is what makes the `default` block behave as expected.** Classes in one group occupy one slot, and an element's own class displaces a default from that slot instead of stacking with it – stacking left both rules matching at equal specificity, so the later one in the stylesheet won and the author's explicit choice silently lost. **Every class that competes for a channel belongs to a slot**, and each of the ones that did not turned out to be a real defect rather than a tidiness argument: `thick`/`bare` (stroke weight) and `mono`/`serif`/`hand` (family) stacked, so a `default box {.thick}` and an element's `{.bare}` both landed and `.mono .hand` on one element had nothing to arbitrate it; **prominence** and **arrowheads** were listed as stacking freely and did not.

  `.emph` and `.dim` are opposites and `.dim` and `.ghost` are two settings of one number, so `dgOpacity()` read `.dim` first and `.ghost` beside it resolved, emitted its class and moved nothing – while `default box {.dim}` under an element's own `{.emph}` stacked, and the element came out with an emphasis stroke drawn at 30%. That slot is `DG_PROMINENCE` itself, which is also the step-verb list and the words a `bars` line takes, so learning one teaches the other.

  Arrowheads went further: **three members for three states**, `no-head` / `one-head` / `both-heads`. Two members for three states is what made the channel incoherent. `.no-head` and `.both-heads` were read as two independent booleans in `dgFrameDrawables`, so the pair drew the *opposite* of the first – no head at the end, one at the start, the stroke trimmed back there to clear it – and **`headed` is derived from `both` now**, one channel resolved once, the way `dgOpacity()` resolves prominence. The deeper fault was that `->` seeded **nothing at all**: the head arrived as the drawn default, so precedence depended on which token was written, and `default edge {.no-head}` beat a written `->` while a written `--` beat `default edge {.both-heads}`. **Every arrow token seeds a class now** (`DG_ARROW_CLASS`), so every edge states this channel explicitly and no default can ever win it – which is why a head class is refused in an element's own tail and in a `default edge` block, and legal only in a `style` step, the one place a token cannot be re-run. The editor's `DGE_SLOTS` had modelled prominence and arrowheads as one row each all along; the grammar has caught up with the panel, not the other way round. A new class arrives with its slot or it arrives broken.

  **Two classes from one slot in one attribute tail is an error** (`rejectSlotPair`). Both used to survive parsing, both landed on the element and both were emitted, so which one the reader saw was decided by stylesheet order – and the lint message about it asserted something untrue, that "which one the drawing takes is not decided by this line", which on an edge carrying two outline classes was wrong twice over because neither was ever taken. It reads the **written tail**, never the resolved set, because an arrow token injects a head class after the tail is parsed.
- **`DG_CLASS_KINDS` is the other half: a class is legal on a kind exactly when that kind draws something it can reach.** One table and one gate, `rejectClassOn`, at the sites `rejectShapeOn` and `rejectAlignOn` used to occupy – and those two survive as one-line delegates, so the call sites and `lint.js`'s import keep reading as the rule they state. A refusal names the *question* the class answers rather than only the word: *".hex is an outline, and an edge has nothing to draw it with – it belongs on a box."* A positive `.class` and a negative `!class` are legal on exactly the same kinds; negation is not an escape hatch for a class a kind can never carry. A step is covered too, because **a tag expands to its members, so a kind-gated class named in a `style` step can reach a member that cannot take it** – and one bad member fails the statement, naming the member and its kind, rather than being quietly filtered out. A set that cannot all take the same act is the wrong set, and saying so is the point of the rule.

  **The kind gate runs first, and the slot check only on what survived it.** Both orders "work"; only this one is true. `edge p -> q {.hex .diamond}` answered the other way round says "an element has one outline", which is false of an edge – an edge has none, which is what the gate just said. Written as two calls at each site that is a convention someone has to remember; written as one function it is structural, which is why `rejectClassOn` collects the survivors and hands them to `rejectSlotPair` itself.
- **`DG_CLASS_CLASHES` is for pairs that act on different channels and still leave one of the two doing nothing.** Not a slot – a shared slot would be a lie about what they do – but the author should hear about it rather than wonder where the words went. Each row carries **its own reason string**, because the reasons have nothing in common but the shape of the failure. `.tone-4` fills with the accent and inverts its own label, so accent ink on it is invisible (the inversion rule is written *after* the accent one, so it wins). And **`.turn` with `.left` / `.right`**: `dgLabelAnchor()` answers `turn` first and returns, so the across-pair never reaches its own branch and moves nothing. Only that pair – measured on the emitted SVG, `.top` and `.bottom` *do* still move a turned label, along the axis its words read up, so the "centred whichever way it reads" rule is about the across-axis alone. It is a rule about node labels now, because the edge reading of those four words has moved to the `side` option.

  **A clash row is a warning, it is beat-aware, and it is the compiler's alone.** A same-slot pair can never become useful at any beat; a clash row is authorable on purpose – `{.tone-4 .accent}` with a `style x {.clear}` at beat 1 gives an accent that is inert while the fill is there and becomes the ink the moment the fill is taken away. So the warning fires only where the pair is live in **every** beat, which is the only reading under which one of the two is definitely doing nothing. That needs the resolved state at each beat, which is why `lint.js` no longer tries: its loop read the tail as written and never resolved a `default` layer down onto an element, and moving the check to where the resolved state exists found two elements in `lectures/network-security` the old one had reported as clean. That is the other half of the bend above: a same-slot pair and a void pair are decidable from the written tail, so the linter raises the compiler's own error; a clash row is not, and a linter stricter than the build is worse than none.
- **`.bare .clear` leaves a box the layout uses and a reader cannot see, and two things have to know that.** `dgDrawsGround(kind, classes)` answers whether an element paints an outline or a fill – and the default differs by kind, which is the whole subtlety: a `box` or a `dot` is filled with the paper unless it says `.clear`, while a free `text` and an `edge` label have no ground at all unless a fill class asks for one. **`--dg-ink-x`**, which tells a stylesheet where the drawing starts inside its own box so `style: {blocks: left}` can put the *ink* on the text edge, takes the leftmost **painted** box: a rect or a circle whose owner draws neither is skipped, labels, images and paths are ink by construction. It used to be the viewBox margin over the viewBox width, which is true for a figure whose leftmost drawable is a shape or a start-anchored label and false for one whose leftmost drawable is a `table`'s frame – always `.bare .clear` – so the correction aimed the whole drawing at an outline nobody paints and the column of cell text stood a padding to the right of the heading above it. **`flush` on a relative placement** answers the same question from the placement side, through `dgInkInset`: zero for anything that draws a ground, the element's own padding for a frame that draws neither, ink to ink on both sides, so two bare tables stacked line their text up rather than their invisible frames. **`gap` deliberately keeps the box** – a gap is a number the author tunes by eye and any ruler makes it as tunable; an alignment is either right or wrong. The one case the classes cannot decide is a frame a statement synthesised, and it goes both ways: a `table` puts its cells' words a padding inside the frame, while a `bars`, a `grid`, a `plot`, a `lanes` and a `sequence` draw their parts flush with it, so `dgInkInset` reads `node.frame` – without that line the tutorial's chart caption walked 13 px out of its own figure and took the viewBox with it.

- **A muted *line* is `--ink-soft` and a muted *word* is not.** `--ink-soft` is picked against the paper, and a caption is very often standing on something else: measured at 1600x900 on the default theme, `--ink-soft` type reads 3.44:1 on the paper, 2.76:1 on a `.tone-1` area and 2.11:1 on a `.tone-3` one, against the 3:1 anything on a projector has to clear. A line has no such floor – an axis is followed, not read – so it keeps the token and the 1.05 weight that say scaffolding, while `.muted text` is mixed straight out of the two inks (`color-mix(in oklab, var(--ink) 60%, var(--paper))`): 5.34 / 4.29 / 3.28 on the same three grounds. Two grounds it cannot answer for, and both are the ground being wrong rather than the type – a `.tone-4` area is the accent at full strength, where only the inverted label rule is legible, and a dark theme's paper, where the mix follows `--ink` and `--paper` and inverts with them.

- **`dgOpacity` returns an element's *ink* opacity, and the stylesheet takes its ground down the rest of the way.** Group opacity is one alpha over everything inside it, so a box faded to 0.3 faded its words to 0.3 as well – 1.95:1 against its own fill on the paper and 1.88:1 standing on a `.tone-3` area, which is not quiet but unreadable. `DG_SOFT` is `{dim: 0.6, ghost: 0.75}` and `DG_SOFT_GROUND` is what `DIAGRAM_CSS` multiplies the shape, the stroke, the arrowhead and an image back down by, so the product is the 0.3 and the 0.45 that were there before, to the pixel: no existing figure's outline or fill moves and only the type inside a softened element gains. It stays inside the rule the old comment records, because the stylesheet touches a **child** of the group and never the group itself – the alphas multiply, so a `hide` still takes the whole element to zero, and the numbers land at once rather than tweening, which is what `dgApplyDiscrete` already does with visibility. Measured after: 4.65 / 4.41 / 4.13 for a dimmed box's label on paper, `.tone-1` and `.tone-3`.

- **`DG_CLASS_VOIDS` is the third table of that family, and the one that is an error.** A pair from two slots where the first *deletes the surface the second draws on*: `.bare` takes the outline off, so `{.bare .dashed}` and `{.bare .dotted}` draw nothing round the element at all. **`.bare` deletes the outline; `.clear` deletes the fill and keeps it** – that one line is the whole vocabulary of the pair, and `{.clear .dashed}` is what the author who wrote `{.bare .dashed}` meant, measured five times in one real keynote where the dashed zone simply never appeared. It is an error rather than a clash warning for the reason a same-slot pair is: it is decidable from the **written tail alone**, with no beat, no layout and no measurement, which is what lets `lint.js` mirror it – both files call `rejectClassOn`, which runs `rejectSlotPair` and then `rejectVoidPair` on what survived the kind gate. `.bare` with `.thick` needs no row: those two *are* one slot. Only two positives are refused; `{!bare .dashed}` under a `default box {.bare}` is exactly the line that takes the pair apart.
- **A free `text` draws a ground only when it carries a fill, and it is the same drawable a box uses.** One mechanism, two defaults: a box's ground is the paper and opts out with `.clear`; a text's is nothing and opts in with a fill. `.paper` is in `DG_FILL_CLASSES` for exactly this reason – leaving it out was a hole where the class resolved, the CSS was emitted, and no rect was drawn for it to colour. Two traps, both of which cost a debugging session: the rect changes the element's **extents**, so it has to go through `put()` like any other drawable or the viewBox is computed from the bare glyph run and clips a padded label at the edge of a figure; and a `style` step can *change* the fill, so the rect is emitted in every frame of any text whose fill **slot** a step touches – a geometry key present in only some frames leaves the rect stranded in the others. Both halves of that condition are wider than they look and both were once narrow: it reads the step's removals as well as its additions, and it tests the whole slot rather than `DG_FILL_CLASSES`, because `.clear` is the slot's way of saying *no* fill. Either omission left a text that starts grounded and loses its ground at a beat with the rect in frame 0 and absent from frame 1, and the runtime visits only the keys a frame mentions – so the ground stayed painted for the rest of the figure. **This is one pattern with three instances now** (print arrowheads, runtime arrowheads, this): a drawable whose presence a beat can change has to be present in every frame, with the numbers saying whether it is there. `vis` cannot carry any of them – `vis` is keyed by element, and these are drawables inside an element's group.
- **An edge's ground goes in after the stroke and the head and before the label**, which is the one order that puts it over the line and under the words. It goes through `put()` for the same reason a text's does, or the frame is measured from the bare glyph run and clips the ground at the edge of a figure. It needs two CSS rules in build.js, both written **after** the tone rules, because those set fill and stroke at the same specificity and source order is what decides. `.dg-edge > rect { stroke: none }`, because a bordered label sitting on a line is a box and there is a statement for that. And a `fill: none` for an edge carrying no tone, the same guard `.dg-text` already needs: an SVG rect with no fill property is black, and this one is emitted in every frame of any edge that is *ever* given a tone – so without it an edge whose label gains a ground at beat 3 draws a black slab across its own line in beats 1 and 2.
- **`.fit` / `.shrink` are solved after the `same as` copy, not before it.** `sizeOf` is otherwise a function of the element's own label and class, which is what lets sizes settle before the DAG walk; a fitted size needs the box, and a copied box is whatever X turned out to be. That works because `same as` is already a dependency edge. `dgFitFont` is a ratio rather than a search, because `dgMeasure` is linear in the size, and the result is clamped to 0.6–1.5×. An element with `.fit` and neither `w` nor `same as` is an **error** – there is nothing to fit into, and a silent no-op is the failure this grammar refuses. The emitter solves each *label variant* separately, because a `label` step swaps pre-rendered `<g>`s and each has to have been typeset at the size that makes its own string fill the box. **`lint.js` deliberately does not mirror the `.fit`-needs-a-width check**: deciding it means resolving `w` through four default layers and `same as`, which is the compiler's job; the build hard-fails with the line, and a linter that guessed would be the one thing worse than no linter – stricter than the build.
- **`default` is position-independent, one per kind.** DOT's position-dependent model is more expressive and was rejected: it makes the source order-sensitive invisibly, which is exactly the class of silent failure this grammar refuses.
- **The block parser looks ahead in exactly three places, and all three are the same problem: a frame whose geometry is a function of lines below it.** A `table`'s height is its row count, and the frame is placed before any cell is – so the statement reads its own rows (the run of bare quoted strings under it, ending at the first blank line, comments passed over) and the loop skips what it consumed off a `rowsRead` counter. A chart's columns have to narrow the moment a second series joins, and the series is written later – so the `series of` lines are tallied in one pass over the body before anything is expanded, then each still expands on its own line, in order, through the ordinary branch. A `sequence`'s height is the sum of its bands, and the frame is placed before any of them – so it reads its own entries, off the same `rowsRead` counter, with one difference `lint.js` has to match exactly: a blank line does not end that run. `step` is the only other statement that takes continuation lines, and it needs no lookahead because nothing about it is sized by them; keep the count of readers-of-other-lines where it is, and note the cost when one of them slips: read as a statement, a bare quoted row reports a keyword that is a quotation mark, which is why `lint.js` names the row instead ("a bare quoted string is a table row") and skips the run off the same count the build uses.
- **Parallel edges are separated by the author, not by the engine.** `mix.right:0.3` slides the attachment point along an edge; two arrows between the same pair at `0.3` and `0.7` are parallel instead of a lens. Automatic fan-out was rejected because it would silently redraw diagrams that already exist.
- **An `.elbow`'s rail is measured between the two *faces*, never between the two centres.** Measured from the faces, two connectors leaving one parent land their rails on the same line and the drawing reads as one bracket, which is what a tree's brackets are made of. From the centres, two children of different heights would each get a rail of their own and the bracket would come apart. The rail is also the only thing the class decides – the axis is whichever one the ends are further apart on, and there is no option to move it, because the moment there is one this stops being a class and starts being a router.
- The four tones are `color-mix` over `--emph` and `--ink`, never fixed hues, so they stay inside whichever of the seven themes is active.

**What a graphical editor has to be able to round-trip.** Three constructs state a *relation* rather than a number, and an editor that answers a drag by replacing them with absolutes destroys the very thing they exist for. The grammar is shaped so it never has to:

- **A coordinate component carries its own signed nudge** (`x0.cy`, `mix.cx+0.2`). Dragging a waypoint rewrites exactly one token – the nudge – and the reference survives. This is why the nudge is one optional signed term with no other operators and no nesting: the token to replace is always unambiguous, and a concrete syntax tree with source spans can rewrite it in place.
- **`align` / `spread` name a set with a master.** Dragging the master should move the group; dragging a follower means either leaving the set (drop the name from the statement) or moving everyone. That is a UI decision, not a format one, but the statement form is what makes either answer a one-line edit.
- **A tag default is shared.** Resizing one element that draws its width from `default box @dec w 0.48` should write an explicit `w` on that element rather than change the default – "just this one" is the safe reading of a drag. Changing the default has to be a deliberate act on the default's own line.

`lint.js` **imports** the diagram vocabulary from `diagram-core.mjs` rather than mirroring it – every table that used to have to change in two files in one commit. Tables only, never a function: a function would pull the whole compiler in behind it and the linter would stop being runnable without the Markdown/Shiki stack. It also **captures the diagram body verbatim, ahead of the heading matchers but behind the fence tracker**: a diagram comment starts with `#`, and read as markdown that is a column heading – while a `::: draw` inside a code fence is a syntax example and must not be compiled. Getting that order wrong made the linter fail any lecture that documented the directive, which is the tutorial the release job publishes. Its `oversized-asset` gate and `collectImageRefs` (for `--optimize-images`) both scan diagram `image` lines too, or the pre-commit gate would let through exactly what `assertInlinable` refuses – and both scan a `::: backdrop`, a `cover-image:` and a `closing-image:` for the same reason. In `build.js` that is one function, `collectDecorationImageRefs`, read by the inline-cap scan and by the optimiser alike; the `image-refs` gate holds them to it.

## Label size: a figure scales as one picture

A label's drawn size is its font-size in canvas units times the ratio of the drawn width to the viewBox. A wide, flat strip is scaled down to the column – labels and all. Measured on a house deck: a `::: draw 150x24` strip under a lead sentence set its labels at **58% of the body text** on the projection and at about 7 px in the handout. **Since 2.0.0 the canvas names this and `--check-fit` reports it from the other end** (see *The two warnings* above): `figure-overflows-canvas` when the drawing is wider or taller than the box its slide reserves, `figure-underfills-canvas` when it uses less than half, `figure-type-small` for a figure with no canvas, and `style: {figure-type}` / `{.figure-type-N}` for the size of a base label against the body type. The fork's own report – `--check-fit` listing every figure whose median label was under 70% of the body text (`figureLabelSizes`, `FIGURE_LABEL_MIN_SHARE`) – gave way to those and is gone.

The recipe, which the canvas reports make a measured step rather than a guess: **fewer canvas units for the same drawing** – `::: draw 60x10` instead of `150x24` sets everything 2.5× larger, labels included; re-space with `gap`/`w`/`h` in the smaller grid. If a strip is too long to shrink its grid, split it into two rows. For print the same fix holds; the handout column is narrower than the projection, so a figure that passes live can still fail on paper.

**The two knobs pull against each other, and this is the failure at the far end of the recipe.** `::: draw WxH` is the grid *cell* in pixels, and `DG_FONT` is a flat 15 px that does not follow it – which is the whole reason the recipe works: shrink the cell and the drawing gets smaller in px, the viewBox with it, and the figure is scaled up harder to fill its measure, so the type lands larger. But `w 2.6` is 2.6 cells, so the boxes shrank too, and past a point a fixed 15 px label no longer fits inside a box that now measures 250 px, or a `gap 4.0` caption no longer fits between two of them. Type that does not scale is a lever in one direction and a trap in the other. Work in both at once: shrink the cell, then re-check the `w` and `gap` numbers against what the labels actually measure.

The compiler measures every one of them and says so – `box a is 1.2 units wide but its label needs about 3.61 – the text will overflow`, and, for a caption with no room between its two ends, the px of ink the boxes are painted over it. **These are the two findings that catch a grid shrunk too far, and they are `[diagram]` lines that do not fail the build**, so on a long lecture they scroll off before the build says it wrote anything. The closing `[diagram] N figure warning(s) above` is there to say one is up there; when you see it, scroll. Neither is something `lint.js` can take over: it never lays a diagram out, so it has no geometry to measure.

**No icons inside a draw body.** A label is measured and emitted as glyphs – there is no icon pass in `diagram-core.mjs` at all – so `box a ":fa-key: Key"` reaches the room as eight literal characters whether or not the lecture sets `icons:`. The prose scan cannot see it (a draw body is captured verbatim, ahead of everything else), so `lint.js` scans the quoted labels itself and warns `icon-in-draw`. Put the mark in the prose beside the figure, or draw it as an element of its own.

## Record bars and leaders to a note

A packet header or record layout is a row of **flat fields**: `default box h 2.4 {.bare .mono}`, then `box t "Type\n1 Byte" at 0,0 w 1.6 {.tone-1}` and each next field `right of <prev> gap 0`. Under `elevation: offset` a toned `.bare` box takes the card tint with no outline and no edge; the first label line (the name) is ink, the lines under it take the tone. Several adjacent fields in one tone read as a group.

The note under a field is a `text`, joined by an edge with **written anchors on crossing axes**: `edge m.bottom -- note.right {.elbow .muted}`. `dgEdgeRoute` routes that with one corner (down from the field, across to the words); two parallel faces keep the two-corner rail. The `text … -- ref` leader is a straight stub by design and does not bend – use the edge when the note sits beside the drop.

## What `lint.js` refuses in a `::: draw` block

These seven run in the zero-dep linter, so they fire on every commit without the
Markdown/Shiki stack. They are the diagram half of the build-and-linter
duplication CLAUDE.md describes: **add a refusal to one file and grep the other
for the same key in the same commit.**

- A statement with no name (`bad-diagram-name`, error) – the build reads the token after the head as the name and refuses the line when there is none.
- The kind gate on a `style` step's classes, in both signs, answered **after the block is read**: a step may name an element declared below it and a tag whose members are. That is why `define()` records what each name draws, generated names included, and why a tag expands to its members with one bad member failing the statement – the compiler's own rule.
- Everything a `bars … series of` line does not own: `w`, `h`, `space` and a placement all belong to the chart it joined, and `stacked` needs a series to stand on.
- An element after the first in a `::: draw` block with no placement (`diagram-no-placement`, error), off the compiler's own `DG_PLACED_HEADS` / `DG_PLACE_INTRO`. The words are matched **positionally**: `point` takes `left` and `right`, so a line-wide test reads `box b "B" point left` as placed, and ten lines of the corpus carry that shape. It counts **nodes**, which is the build's own test for "is this the first element", and exempts a `bars … series of` line, which joins another chart's frame and refuses a placement by name. It also stays quiet on a line this gate has already reported on – one authored defect, one causal diagnostic, which is the nearest a linter gets to the build's "the statement stopped reading" rule. **It is collected and reported at the end of the block**, not on the line, because a `row` or a `col` further down may be this element's placement.
- A `row` or a `col` of fewer than two elements, or one with a word after its `gap` (`bad-diagram-row`, error). Both mirror the compiler line for line; what the linter cannot answer is anything about the sizes the statement settles, which needs the figure laid out.
- The two band refusals (`bad-diagram-zone`, error), both **collected and decided at the end of the block** for the reason `diagram-no-placement` is: an area may be written after the things that stand in it. `in q` and `q.inner.left` where `q` is not a `zone`; and an area with an axis nobody wrote and nothing placed in it, which has no size to take from anywhere. A coordinate pair naming one band twice is one sentence, not two – the build reports it off the element.
- `anchor` or `flush` on an `in` (`bad-diagram-placement`, error), and the band's own five words (`DG_IN_ALIGN`) accepted after it; `row … in <zone>` with its words, which also makes the row's *first* member placed, where every other form leaves it owing a placement. What the linter cannot answer is whether what stands in a band fits in it: that is `dgZoneFitWarnings`, and it needs the figure laid out.

`diagram-ragged-labels` is gone from this list, with the compiler's
`dgLabelAnchorWarnings`: both described a free `.left` text centred on its
coordinate, which the fifth placement trap no longer lets happen.

## The diagram editor (`editor.mjs`, `editor.css`)

**Development state, like `::: draw` itself.** The spec, the build plan and a running build log are in `editor.md`; §15 there is the thing to read before picking the work up. What follows is only the part a change to this repo has to not break.

Ships into the live views whenever the lecture contains a diagram, gated by the `editor:` frontmatter key (`both` / `speaker` / `none`). **Measured in the built page: ~440 KB** of compiler, UI and chrome, on top of the 276 KB of fonts – the difference between building `lectures/diagrams` as it stands and building it with `editor: none`. (The plan's estimate of ~150 KB was taken at phase 3, before the UI existed, and the 295 KB re-measurement before the docking, alignment, step-pane and layout-control slices.) A lecture with no diagram pays nothing, and each figure additionally carries its own source – a couple of hundred bytes to a couple of kilobytes – plus, only in a view that ships the editor, the markup for any image it holds.

- **It edits source text, not a model.** It parses the block, records where every token sits, answers a drag by rewriting the smallest span it can, and re-runs the same compiler the build runs. There is no second representation to drift and no file the editor owns. `createSpanTable()` in `diagram-core.mjs` is the whole interface between a gesture and the source.
- **The panel reads its controls off the *statement*, not off the kind.** A `bars`, `grid` or `plot` frame is a `box` as far as the layout is concerned, so `dgeKindOpts` keyed on `el.kind` offered it `pad` – a word its statement refuses – and never offered `space`, which it takes. The frame carries `frame: <statement>` for exactly this. The same distinction closed a live trap: `spanOf(id, 'label')` returns the first quoted token, which on a `bars` line is *the values*, so the panel's label field was one keystroke from overwriting a chart's data under a name that gave no warning. A frame now has no label span and no label field.
- **A step is shown by what it *does*, not by what it says.** `dgeStepChanges` diffs the resolved state either side of the beat, because the ops are not the answer: `show @xor` is one line and three elements, an edge appears because both its ends did, a container because its members did. The result is a chip per affected element in the panel and a dashed mark on the drawing, and without it the only way to learn what a beat is for was to press Space and watch. The step pane sits **above** the empty-selection branch – it describes the beat, and "nothing selected" is exactly when that matters most.
- **Panel chips need a class per pane.** Waypoints, tags and a step's ops all render as `.dge-chip`, so a selector naming only that picks whichever pane is first in the DOM. A spec removing waypoints started deleting step ops the day a pane was added above it; `.dge-chip-via` is the fix, and the rule is the general one.
- **An option gets a control when the vocabulary is a closed word list**, not only when it is a number. `point` (which way a chevron or a wedge aims) is a swatch row like a class slot, offered only where the resolved outline actually has a point – a control that can only produce a compiler refusal is not a control. `DG_KEYED_ATTRS` is what makes a `keyword value` option addressable at all; anything positional (a `bars` values string, a `grid`'s `8x12`, a `plot`'s axis titles) is still a text edit.
- **`editor.mjs` and `editor.css` are read from disk and inlined**, like `diagram-core.mjs`. That is what makes them ordinary files: a backtick or a `\s` in them means what it says, where the same character in `AUDIENCE_JS` is a parse error or a silently broken regex. The wrapper escapes `</script`; `editor.css` goes through `assertStylesheetsWellFormed()`.
- **A gesture plans against the state it started from.** `dgeGestureBase()` captures `{source, model, boxes, spans}` at pointerdown, and the viewBox is pinned for the duration. Without either, each `pointermove` measures its delta against a mapping the previous move already changed, and the drag compounds – a 60px drag came out as `gap 8.45`.
- **Zoom is the frame's size, not a transform.** A transform does not change the layout box, so a frame wider than the canvas is clamped to the start edge by the grid instead of being centred, and the scaled figure sits off to the side. Pan stays a transform, which is exactly the thing that should not affect layout.
- **The chrome keys off `body[data-mode]`, never a theme name** – the same rule the help sheet, the TOC, the search panel and the cockpit footer follow, and it is why the editor works in all seven themes including the two phosphor modes. The canvas needs nothing: it is the compiler's own SVG, already painted in `--ink` / `--paper` / `--rule`.
- **The modal owns the keyboard.** While it is open the view's own handler is off entirely, or every tool key would also do something to the lecture underneath. Verified, not assumed: `Space` `C` `F` `A` `↓` `B` leave the active chunk, the reveal count, the theme, the font, the collapse mode and the blank state untouched.
- **Opening the editor must not disturb `revealed[chunkId]`.** It opens at the beat on screen, its own beat navigation is editor state and writes nothing back, and closing leaves the slide where it was. That counter is the single piece of state the reveal, the sync, the freeze gate and the localStorage recovery all share.
- **A structured edit that stops the block compiling is reverted, not kept.** `dgeSetSource` is the one door every panel act and every gesture commit goes through, and if the result does not parse it puts the source back and shows the compiler's sentence. Two reasons, and the second is the serious one: the panel is not a text editor, so an illegal act is an objection to read rather than damage to repair – and **`DGE.spans` is only rebuilt on a successful compile**, so a block left broken leaves the span table describing text that no longer exists. Every later edit then splices at offsets that have moved. That is how two more clicks turned an attribute tail into `{.a}.b}.c}` while the canvas never changed, because it never compiled again: the panel looked like it was doing nothing at all. `DGE.spansFor` records what the table describes, and a gesture that finds it stale says so instead of dragging against it.
- **Docking is a drag with no modifier, and that is deliberate.** Four chips appear around whatever the pointer is over during a move, and releasing on one rewrites the whole placement to `<side> of <that element>`. `Ctrl/Cmd` already suspends snapping and `Alt` leaves an align set; a third would be a lot to hold, and `Shift` means axis-constrain in every drawing tool. Releasing *on a chip* is itself the commitment, so the gesture guards itself. Two things it must keep: the host is found from the **pointer** and its geometry read from **`ctx.boxes`**, the layout as it was at pointerdown – the element is moving under the preview and the layout is re-solved on every move, so anything read live slides about while it is being aimed at. And the chip decides the *side* only: measuring a distance from where the pointer happens to be gives nearly zero every time, so the element keeps the gap it already had.
- **A control in the guide layer cannot rely on event identity across two events.** `dgeDrawGuides` replaces every child on each recompile, and a gesture ends with one – so the second click of a double-click lands on a *different node* carrying the same id. A `dblclick` listener therefore fires on the two nodes' common ancestor and finds no handle, and the browser resets `pointerdown`'s own `detail` counter for the same reason. Both look like working controls and neither fires: waypoint deletion shipped with no way at all to take one off the canvas. Position and time are what survive the repaint – see `dgeIsSecondTap`.
- **The entry point lives in the focus card and must stay outside it.** The pencil is appended to `document.body`, not to `#psiINT-figure-overlay` – it is `position: fixed` either way, and putting it inside the subtree its own `MutationObserver` watches makes its insertion a mutation, which re-runs the sync, which inserts it again. That loop hangs the tab.
- **Four tiers for where an edit goes**, tried in order: the `--watch` socket (now two-way), the clipboard, File System Access where it exists, and `localStorage` for a reader whose `audience.html` is a build artefact. The watch server refuses a patch unless the nonce matches this build, the range is one a `::: draw` block actually occupied, the bytes there still match what that block compiled from, **and** the bytes the page believes are there still match – the last check is what stops a second tab silently taking the first one's change when an edit happens to keep the block's length.
- **The watch socket binds to `127.0.0.1`.** It omitted `host` before, which for a one-way reload socket was untidy and for one that can write to the author's disk is not.
- **An edit syncs as its own message**, `diagram-edit`, following the `video` precedent rather than the state snapshot – see `speaker.md` §2 for why, and for the rest of that table. Three things keep that sync honest: an edit committed while frozen is queued and flushed on thaw (`psiEditorThaw`, called by `toggleFreeze`); a received edit is persisted the way a local one is, or reopening the editor loaded pre-edit source and the next gesture reverted the peer's work; and under `editor: speaker` the message carries the compiled figure too, because the projection ships no compiler. The DOM half of applying an edit – swapping the drawing, its frames payload, the runtime and the focus-card clone – is `dgSwapFigure` in the shared diagram runtime, one text for the editor's path and the no-editor path.
- **`frozen` and `state` are top-level `let`/`const` in a classic script**, so they are *not* properties of `window`. The editor reads the freeze state off `#psiINT-freeze-btn`, which is the same fact made visible. Function declarations (`sendToPeer`, `dgRenderInto`) are global and can be called directly.
