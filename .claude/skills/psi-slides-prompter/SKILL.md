# The live prompter (`--prompter`)

Lifted out of `CLAUDE.md` so it loads when the prompter is the work rather than
in every session. `docs/history/PLAN-souffleuse.md` is the design and, in its *Decisions along
the way*, the record of where the code and the plan parted company; where the two
disagree the code is right.

**“Souffleuse” is the internal codename, and it survives only where nobody
types it.** Every author-facing name says *prompter*: the four `--prompter*`
flags, the `prompter:` frontmatter block, the `prompter-*.jsonl` log and
`prompter-*.prompt.txt`, the `prompter` `--events` type and stdin command, and
the `unknown-prompter-setting` lint code. File and identifier names keep the
codename – `souffleuse.mjs`, `SOUFFLEUSE_*`, `createSouffleuse`,
`souffleuseCues`, the `souffleuse-*` socket messages, the `psi-slides:souffleuse*`
storage keys, the `#souffleuse-*` cockpit ids, `test/souffleuse.mjs` and
`test/gates/souffleuse.mjs`. Logs written before the rename are called
`souffleuse-*.jsonl`, and `--prompter-replay` reads them the same way: it
takes whatever file it is given and never checks the prefix.

It is a prompter in the theatre sense: whispers from the box, briefly, only when
needed, and the room notices nothing. What it may be about is six kinds – the
clock, a missing example, a probable factual slip, the manner of the delivery,
the tempo (measured in code, not guessed at) and something the speaker's own
notes planned that the talk has walked past. A hint has **at most twelve words** and the
normal answer to a call is `nothing`. It may also lay a cue card into a slide
that is still to come. It is not an author that rewrites slides, not a
fact-checker with research, not a recorder – the log is text – and not part of
the desktop app, which promises three times in public that nothing leaves the
machine.

**Restraint is the requirement, not polish.** The judgement – *is that a factual
slip?* – is the model's. The policy – *may one come now at all?* – is in code, in
`souffleuse.mjs`, so it is decided by a gate in milliseconds without a key, a
socket or a microphone. That split is the load-bearing decision: a talk where
nothing came looks exactly like a talk where nothing was due, so restraint is the
half of this feature no rehearsal can show you. If you are tempted to move a rule
into the prompt, that is the thing you are giving up.

## Where the code lives

| where | what |
|---|---|
| `souffleuse.mjs` | everything pure: `KINDS`, `SEVERITIES`, `MAX_WORDS`, `START_QUIET_S`, `CLOCK_JUMP_S`, `PACE_WPM`, `DELIVERY_MIN_SAMPLE_S`, `TOOL_SCHEMA`, `wordCount`, `prefixHash`, `deckPayload`, `flattenMarks`, `cueTargets`, `systemPrefix`, `speechStats`, `paceVerdict`, `tickMessage`, `parseAnswer`, `driftSeconds`, `timeHintAllowed`, `rebaseClock`, `shouldTick`, `createPolicy`, `replayAnswers`. Zero imports, zero Node APIs, and the gate asserts both plus the exact export list |
| `build.js` § `// ── souffleuse (--prompter) ──` | `createSouffleuse({absIn, opts, sendToCockpit, emitEvent, log})` → `{onBuild, onMessage, say, setEnabled, close, logPath}`, plus `souffleuseLogPath` and the constants. Both modules are imported **dynamically here**, so no other build reads either file |
| `build.js` § `// ── the live prompter's CSS and runtime (--prompter only) ──` | `SOUFFLEUSE_CSS` and `SOUFFLEUSE_JS`: the cockpit's Web Speech adapter, switch, strip, badge, history, interim line and cue merge, and the rules that dress them. **Two literals of their own because they are spliced only under the flag**, the way `editorPayload` is – `${SPEAKER_CSS}${souffleuseCss}` inside the same `<style>`, `${SPEAKER_JS}${souffleuseRuntime}` inside the same `<script>`. The runtime must be in that script element: it reads `flatChunks`, `state`, `viewHooks`, `cueSync`, `cueOn`, `cuePosition`, `souffleuseCues`, `applyCueMode`, `flashMode`, `escText`, `elapsedSeconds`, `tStart` and `PSI_CARDS` out of `SPEAKER_JS`'s scope. Before the split, 36 KB of prompter rode in every `speaker.html` anybody ever built |
| `build.js`, `SPEAKER_JS` § cue cards | the two pieces a cockpit carries either way: `const souffleuseCues = new Map()` and the merge at the end of `cueCardsFor`. The rail is drawn from them, and drawing it cannot depend on a literal that may not have been spliced; over an empty Map both are free. Everything else the prompter touches in this window is *chained* from `SOUFFLEUSE_JS` – `viewHooks.onActiveChange`, `onStateChange`, and `applyCueMode` (which is how `cuePlaceStrip` gets called without a line inside it) |
| `build.js`, `SOUFFLEUSE_SPEC` / `souffleuseSettings` / `talkDuration` | the frontmatter, validated in the `buildOnce` pre-flight so `--print-only` refuses a typo too |
| `build.js`, `renderSpeaker` | emits the chrome, `const SOUFFLEUSE = {lang, cadence, cues, label}` – `null` without the flag – and the two conditional splices. Without the flag the only trace in `speaker.html` is that null, the cue merge above, and the `onShiftS` / `escapePrompter` hooks in `AUDIENCE_JS`, which the projection carries too because they are the hook contract |
| `build.js`, `runWatch` | tracks the socket of the last `souffleuse-hello` as `cockpit`, routes the `souffleuse-*` family after the nonce check, and abandons anything in flight on `exit` |
| `lint.js` | `SOUFFLEUSE_ENUMS`, `SOUFFLEUSE_NUM_KEYS`, `SOUFFLEUSE_FREE_KEYS` and `nestedBlockKeys`; the codes `unknown-prompter-setting` and `bad-duration` |
| `test/gates/souffleuse.mjs`, `test/souffleuse.mjs` | the restraint without a network, and the three processes wired to each other |

`notesToCards` is **injected, not imported**: `deckPayload(lecture,
{notesToCards})`, the way `createDiagramCompiler({…})` takes its Node leaves.
Without it the notes still travel, as prose, and carry no `@mm:ss` marks – a
degradation, not a failure. There is exactly one text in this repository that
knows the cue-card grammar, and this keeps it that way.

## Configuration

| surface | what |
|---|---|
| `--prompter` | run the sidecar. **Only together with `--watch`** – a usage error otherwise, because the watch socket is the only channel the cockpit has |
| `--prompter-model ID` | an OpenRouter model id; beats the frontmatter and the default. **Refused without `--prompter`**, because it is read nowhere else: on its own it built an ordinary deck with no prompter and said nothing |
| `--prompter-dry-run` | everything but the one call. The ear, the socket, the moves, the tick scheduler, the policy and the log all run; `ask` is skipped and logged as `answer {dryRun: true}`, **between a `thinking` and a `listening`**, so the cockpit's heartbeat counts the calls that would have gone out – a dry run that only ever said `listening` showed that one word for a whole talk, in the mode whose job is answering "is this wired up". **It needs no key** – which is the point of it: it is the rehearsal tool, and the way to read a `tick` message, with its state line and its window, on a machine with no account. Refused without `--prompter`, like the model id |
| `--prompter-replay FILE` | no watcher, no browser, no renderer, no network: read a finished run's `prompter-*.jsonl` back through **today's** parser and **today's** policy and print, per answer, what the model proposed and what the policy would do with it now. `node build.js <source.md> --prompter-replay prompter-20260911-1015.jsonl`. It is how a threshold gets changed with evidence rather than by feel; the pure half is `replayAnswers` in `souffleuse.mjs`. **A `dismiss` line is applied** (`policy.dismissed`), mapped through the `hint` line that named the live id onto the replay's own hint for the same answer – skipped, a slot the speaker had emptied stayed full and every low hint after it read `standing` |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | required. Without it the sidecar starts `disabled`: nothing is sent, the console says so once, a `hello` says so, the badge says so – and the transcript is still logged, because a missing key is not a reason to lose the debrief. **A key that is not printable ASCII (`SOUFFLEUSE_KEY_RE`, `/^[\x21-\x7e]+$/`) is refused the same way**, in words that do not contain it, and never put into a header: one with a line break in it made undici throw an error quoting the header, and the key went to the log, the terminal, the badge and `--events`. Beyond that, **every string the sidecar writes anywhere goes through `redact`** – `log`, `emit`, `sendToCockpit` and `logLine` are wrapped at the top of `createSouffleuse`, so an endpoint that echoes the request cannot put the key on a badge either |
| `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` | another OpenAI-compatible endpoint, default `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`. This is how the spec's fake OpenRouter is reached. One that is not `https` and not loopback is warned about at start: the deck, the transcript and the key would cross the network in the clear |
| `PSI_PROMPTER_FREE_CLOCK=1` | **test-only.** Turns off `clampSpan` and `shouldTick`'s `wallSince` (see *The tick scheduler*), because `test/souffleuse.mjs` moves the cockpit's clock by hand and every compressed minute would otherwise count as two seconds. Read from the environment only, so no page can throw it |

Frontmatter, nested like `style:`; `SOUFFLEUSE_SPEC` is the table and the bounds
are the build's:

| key | kind | default | bounds |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | any OpenRouter model id | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` | non-empty |
| `language` | BCP-47 tag | falls back to `lang:` | `en`, `de`, `de-DE`, … |
| `cadence` | seconds of new speech that earn a call | 25 | 10 … 120 |
| `cooldown` | seconds a shown hint buys, across every kind | 20 | 10 … 600 |
| `cues` | may it lay cards into upcoming slides | `on` | `on` / `off` |
| `calls-per-hour` | the most calls in any sixty minutes, a hard ceiling on what a run can cost | 360 | 10 … 1000 |

`duration:` sits at the **top level**, not in the block: it is a property of the
talk like `lang:`, and the cockpit's clock can measure against it whether or not
a prompter is listening. `duration: 45` is minutes, `45:00` and `1:30:00` are
clocks, twelve hours is the ceiling, and anything else fails the build.

Precedence: CLI, then frontmatter, then default. In the cockpit the frontmatter
is a **ceiling** for the cue preference rather than a default – a deck with
`cues: off` does not get cards because a browser preference says otherwise.

## The socket protocol

The `souffleuse-*` family rides the existing nonce-guarded watch socket and its
`<type>-result` pairing; `speaker.md` §3.1 is the reference and repeats the
tables. The one new mechanism is that the **server may speak first**, through
`psiWatch.on(type, fn)` – a listener map consulted *after* the `-result` pairing,
never instead of it – with `psiWatch.onConnect(fn)` firing on every open
including the silent reconnects, and `psiWatch.ask(type, body)` as the other
direction.

**Who may reach it at all** is decided before the nonce: `verifyClient` takes a
handshake only from a page opened from disk (Origin `null` or `file://`) or one
`--serve` delivered (`http://localhost|127.0.0.1|[::1]:<servedPort>`), and no
Origin at all, which is not a browser. Messages over `WATCH_MAX_PAYLOAD` (4 MB)
are refused unread. `speaker.md` §3.1 has the rest.

**A reconnect says hello again, and a refused hello switches the cockpit off.**
The socket reconnects itself, a session does not: after a reconnect the sidecar
has no cockpit to whisper to until one registers, and the switch and the
preference are sent again because the watcher may have been restarted under the
page. A restarted watcher has a **new nonce**, which this page does not have
until a save reloads it – so the hello comes back `{ok: false}` and every
segment sent after it is refused too. The handler used to return there, leaving
the switch pressed, the microphone open and a heartbeat saying `listening`, so
it now does what `souffStart` does with the same refusal: the reason on the
badge, `souffStop(true)`, the switch back up.

Client → server: `souffleuse-hello {lang, stt:{engine, local, onDevice, installing}}`
(`onDevice` is Chrome's verdict for each spelling of the language that was
tried, `installing` the tag a download was actually asked for – without the two
the log cannot say why a machine with the model installed is still talking to a
server),
`souffleuse-say {text, t0, t1, chunkId, idx, beat}`,
`souffleuse-move {chunkId, idx, beat, beats, elapsed}`,
`souffleuse-dismiss {hintId, how}` (`esc` / `click` / `fade`),
`souffleuse-toggle {on}`, `souffleuse-prefs {cues}`. Server → client:
`souffleuse-hint {hintId, kind, text, severity, at}` with `kind` one of
`time` / `example` / `fact` / `delivery` / `pace` / `skipped`,
`souffleuse-cue {cueId, chunkId, text, at}`,
`souffleuse-status {state, why}`.

Six things about it that are not guessable:

- **A `hello` is a registration, not a switch.** It says which socket to
  whisper to, re-stamps the cockpit clock and calls `policy.forgetStanding()`,
  because a fresh page holds no hint. `souffleuse-toggle` and `setEnabled` are
  the only two things that turn `on` on. It used to switch on by itself, and
  the cockpit then had to undo that with a separate, un-awaited
  `souffleuse-toggle {on: false}` whenever the answer said `enabled: false` –
  so a lost reply, or a `souffStt.start` that threw, left the sidecar
  listening and calling a model for a cockpit whose switch was off. A hello
  that is not a switch also says nothing on the status channel unless it is
  news (`off` when disabled, `listening` when already running): an `idle` here
  would race the cockpit's own switch-on and undo it.
- **The `hello` reply is `{enabled, model, cadence, cues, cueCards, session,
  dryRun, startQuiet}` and the refusal rides in the protocol's own `why`,** with
  `ok` still true. `startQuiet` is how the cockpit knows how long the minute it
  cannot be helped in actually is – it is what the line under the strip switches
  on (*The line under the strip does two jobs*, below).
  Beyond that, `reply` spreads the payload *first* so that no payload field can shadow a
  protocol one, which means a payload `why` would be overwritten by the
  protocol's. `cues` is the *permission* and `cueCards` the cards already laid
  – two different things, which is why they cannot share a name. The cards
  live in the cockpit's memory alone, so a reload lost every one of them while
  the sidecar went on holding those slides locked against a second; the reply,
  and `souffleuse-prefs`', hands them back.
- **`souffleuse-prefs {cues}` is the cue checkbox**, sent after a successful
  hello and on every change. Its own message rather than a field of
  `souffleuse-toggle`, because the box is changed mid-talk with the switch
  untouched. The deck's `prompter: {cues: off}` is the ceiling, this is the
  speaker's answer under it, and `cuesAllowed` is the conjunction: with the
  cards off `cueTargets` is empty, so no cue is judged, no slide is locked and
  nothing enters the duplicate rule.
- **A `hello` re-stamps the cockpit's clock** inside the sidecar, and switching
  on re-stamps `onAtElapsed` with it. Stamped at creation instead, the minutes an
  author spent writing slides counted as minutes of the talk and the opening
  quiet was over before it began.
- **A move is resolved by `idx`, never by id.** A divider's element id in the
  cockpit is `<col-id>-section`, while `deckPayload` gives it the column's own id
  (or `col:N`): the two agree on position and not on name. `cueTargets` skips
  dividers altogether – a cue is a card in a cue list and a divider has none.
- **The conclusion is always a cue target.** `cueTargets(deck, idx, count)`
  offers the next `count` addressable slides *and* the end of the deck – its
  last addressable slide, and its `closing:` chunk when it has one – because a
  sentence worth keeping is usually said long before the place it belongs, and
  that place is usually the conclusion, which a window of three slides reaches
  only in the last minute of the talk. The state line names it as a field of
  its own (`conclusion=closing-words`) rather than marking it inside the list:
  the ids in `cue_targets` are copied verbatim into the answer, so an id
  carrying a decoration is an id the model gets wrong. **A conclusion the
  speaker is standing on is not offered**, and that is the answer rather than
  an oversight: a card for the slide on the screen is something to say now, and
  the thing that says something now is a hint on the strip.
- **The states are five and two of them are not the same thing.** `listening`
  and `thinking` are the working pair; `off` is the sidecar saying it cannot work
  at all and carries the reason; `idle` is the prompter having been switched off,
  which reverses on the next press; `error` is a backoff or a run of unusable
  answers. **The cockpit acts on `idle` exactly as it does on `off`** – stops
  the ear, unpresses the switch, clears the strip and its timers, drops the
  consent in `sessionStorage` – and the only difference is the badge, which
  `off` writes its reason onto and `idle` leaves alone. `idle` used to set the
  button's state and nothing else, so a driver switching the prompter off on
  stdin left the microphone open, took two presses to undo, and a reload in
  between said hello and switched the sidecar back on behind the speaker. Without a sidecar the socket answers `start the build with
  --prompter`.
- **A second cockpit takes the hints over by saying hello, and the first one
  is told.** `runWatch` sends the displaced socket `souffleuse-status {state:
  'idle', why: 'another cockpit took the prompter'}` before replacing it – so
  the ear stops and the switch goes back up, which is what the cockpit already
  does with an `idle`. It used to happen in silence, and a second tab is one
  stray `S` in the projection away: the first window kept its switch pressed
  and its microphone open for the rest of the talk, sending a transcript
  nothing would answer.

## The tick scheduler

`shouldTick` decides, and the sidecar's `maybeTick` calls it from every `say` and
every `move`:

- A **slide** occasion on a changed `idx`, at the earliest 8 s after the last
  tick – paging through three slides to reach one is not three occasions.
  **The 8 s are the sidecar's wall seconds** (`wallSince`, below), not the
  cockpit's.
- A **speech** occasion when the speech seconds since the last tick reach
  `cadence` **and** at least 8 new words arrived. Silence is never an occasion,
  and the seconds are seconds of speech (`t1 - t0` per segment), not wall
  seconds.
- Never two calls in flight. A second occasion is coalesced into `pendingReason`
  and fired the moment the answer lands (`finish`), and a slide occasion outranks
  a speech one because the slide is the newer fact about where the talk is.
- The clock is the **cockpit's**, carried forward with the wall clock between
  messages (`nowElapsed`), which is what makes a cadence in seconds mean seconds.
  **It can go backwards**, because `tStart` in the cockpit is the page load and
  a `--watch` rebuild reloads the page on every save. The cockpit keeps its
  origin now, and the sidecar does not rely on that: an `elapsed` that drops by
  more than `CLOCK_JUMP_S` (5 s) is a new clock, and `rebaseClock` moves the
  switch-on stamp, the last tick and the whole transcript onto it by one delta,
  dropping what is older than the new zero. A talk already past its opening
  quiet stays past it – a running talk is not made to sit through the minute
  again – and one still inside it has the stamp re-read against the new clock.
  **`policy.rebase(delta)` is the other half and is called beside it**, with
  the strip's own record (`hints[].at`) and the laid cards (`cues[].at`): the
  policy's `lastShownAt`, its per-kind stamps, the standing hint and every
  history row are stamped on the same clock, and moving one without the other
  left every cool-down answering to a clock nobody was on – a hint shown at
  25:00, a new tab starting near 0:00, and every `low` hint refused as
  `cooldown` for twenty-five minutes, which reads in the log exactly like the
  policy working. The *ages* survive the move, which is the principle: a hint
  shown a second before the jump was shown a second ago, not never.
  `shouldTick` reads a negative gap as *no reference*, not as *no time passed*:
  before that, one restarted clock stopped every slide tick for the rest of the
  talk.
- In the first `startQuiet` seconds after the switch, ticks run and the policy
  lets nothing through – the calls are what warms the prompt cache.
- **What a page says is held to what a page could know.** The stamps are the
  cockpit's, and the cadence is counted in them, so a page claiming a minute
  of speech per message earned a call per message. `clampSpan` (pure, in
  `souffleuse.mjs`) moves a segment's `t0` up so that `t1 - t0` is no more
  than the wall seconds since the segment before it arrived plus
  `SOUFFLEUSE_SPAN_SLACK_S` (2 s); `lastSayWall` is re-stamped by every `say`
  and every `hello`. **That is per message, and a flood of messages was a
  flood of slack**: a page with the nonce stamping every move eight cockpit
  seconds after the last and every say with a second of speech had 78 calls in
  20 s out of a dry run. So `shouldTick` also takes `wallSince` – the wall
  seconds since the count started (`sinceTick.wall`, re-stamped by every tick,
  the switch and a rebase) – and with it the slide floor is measured on that,
  and the speech credited since the last call is held to it plus the slack
  *once*. Left out (`--prompter-replay`, which has no wall clock), both rules
  read the cockpit's clock as before; `PSI_PROMPTER_FREE_CLOCK=1` leaves it
  out too. **Only the first call of a run skips the floor, and the sidecar
  says which one that is with a flag of its own** (`ticked`): `rebaseClock`
  clears the last-tick stamp when it lands before the new zero, and the
  cleared stamp read as "no call yet" – a page alternating `move {elapsed:
  1000}` and `move {elapsed: 0}` had thirty calls in under a second. **Every id or name a page sends is cut before it is logged**:
  `pageString` holds a chunk id, a hint id, a dismissal's `how` and the
  recogniser's name to `SOUFFLEUSE_ID_MAX` (200) and a `lang` to
  `SOUFFLEUSE_LANG_MAX` (35) – a hundred kilobytes in a `dismiss` used to be a
  hundred kilobytes on a line of the debrief. A segment is also cut to `SEGMENT_MAX_CHARS` (2,000, the
  newest characters) on arrival, and `windowOf` cuts the newest segment of a
  window to the window's words and to the same character count, marked `… `
  – it used to keep that one whole, and a security review had a megabyte in
  a tick message.
- **The hour's budget is the backstop behind all of it.** `budgetLeft()` runs
  before every tick, in `maybeTick` and in `finish`; `callTimes` holds the wall
  stamps of the last sixty minutes, dry-run calls included so a rehearsal
  shows where it would bite. Spent, it says so once (a `warn` line, a status
  `error`) and ticks nothing until the oldest call ages out.

## The request

`POST <base>/chat/completions`, `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, `X-Title:
psi-slides`, `HTTP-Referer` the repository (both show on OpenRouter's activity
page, which is where somebody with the bill goes to ask what spent it). Body:

- `model`, `max_tokens: 320`, `temperature: 0.2`. Twelve words need a handful
  of tokens; the ceiling is there for the `why` that goes to the log, and it
  was 160 until the first rehearsal ran into it: the tool call came back cut
  off mid-JSON and was read as the model talking nonsense. Output is billed
  by what is generated, so the headroom costs nothing
- `reasoning: {effort: 'low', exclude: true}` – think a little, do not send the
  thinking back; latency is the scarce resource
- `messages`: the system prefix as **one content block carrying
  `cache_control: {type: 'ephemeral'}`**, then the tick message as the user turn
- `tools: [TOOL_SCHEMA]`, `tool_choice: {type: 'function', function: {name:
  'advise'}}`, `parallel_tool_calls: false` – the answer's vocabulary *is* the
  tool schema, so the call is forced and there is exactly one of it. There is no
  read tool: the whole deck is already in the cached prefix and a round trip
  would spend the latency the hint has to arrive inside of
- `session_id`: the prefix hash, for sticky routing to the provider holding the
  warm cache. A rebuild changes the hash and starts a new one
- `usage: {include: true}`, so `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` in the
  log answers whether the cache is working at all

`AbortController` at `SOUFFLEUSE_TIMEOUT_MS` (8 s): what arrives later is too
late for the sentence it was about.

The prefix is **byte-stable per build** – that is the whole point of splitting it
from the tick message – and `prefixHash` is FNV-1a over the UTF-16 code units as
eight hex digits, because `crypto` would have been the first Node API in a file
whose contract is that it has none and a collision costs a cache miss.

**What the prefix holds** (`systemPrefix`): the role and the rules, then the deck
– title, language, planned duration, slide count, and per slide its number, id,
type, part, heading, each beat's screen text, the notes as bullets with the beat
they are said on, and the `@mm:ss` marks. `deckPayload` builds it off the parsed
`lecture` (`buildOnce` returns it for this one caller), capped at about 1500
characters of screen text and 2500 of notes per chunk, with a compiled `::: draw`
reduced to `[figure, steps: N]` and code fences keeping their lines – a speaker
can misstate code, and that is a `fact` hint. **A divider carries its own notes
and marks** (`col.speakerNotes`, unpinned on beat 0 as the cockpit files them):
it used to get `notes: [], marks: []`, so a `@10:00` under a `#` heading was a
mark the cockpit's `cueMarkList` counted and the sidecar's `flattenMarks` did
not, and the two reported different drifts for one talk.

**What the tick message holds** (`tickMessage`): a state line (`slide 12/38 · #id
· beat 2/3 · elapsed · drift · time_hint_allowed · cue_targets=[…] ·
conclusion=#id`), then **the delivery line** where there is one, then the last
five hints with `✕` on the ones the speaker dismissed – they are in the list
precisely because they must not come back – and a rolling window of about 90 s or
600 words with `NEW:` marking what arrived since the last call.

### The delivery, measured rather than judged

**The model has no tempo information at all.** It receives text, and speaking
rate, hesitation, filler density and long silences are absent from text – so
"notice that I am speaking too fast" was never a prompting problem, it was
missing input. `speechStats({transcript, now, window, lang})` counts it over
the same rolling window the transcript rides in (**one walk**, `windowOf`,
shared with `tickMessage`, because two would describe two different stretches
of the same talk) and answers:

| field | what |
|---|---|
| `words` | words in the window, `wordCount`, so a CJK character counts one |
| `seconds` | the seconds actually **spoken** – the sum of `t1 - t0`, never wall time, because silence is not speech. **Every figure here is only as good as the ear's stamp**: `t0` is the start of the utterance (`speechstart`, or the first interim after a final), and while it was the end of the *previous* final the pause between two sentences sat inside the segment – so `longestGap` was structurally 0, a sentence after a minute of thinking was rated at ten words a minute, and the sample floor was reached on silence alone |
| `sampled` | the same figure rounded: what the line prints and what the floor is compared against, so one number is read everywhere |
| `wpm` | `words` over `seconds`, or **null** with nothing to divide by |
| `fillers`, `fillersPerMin` | filler *sounds* only, per minute of speech |
| `longestGap` | the biggest hole between one segment's `t1` and the next's `t0` – a speaker who has lost the thread goes quiet |
| `segments` | how many finals the figures rest on |

`paceVerdict(wpm)` is `slow | easy | brisk | fast | very-fast`, read off
`PACE_WPM` (`easy` 110, `brisk` 150, `fast` 170, `veryFast` 190 – published
guidance for presenting sits at roughly 100 to 150 wpm, and the top is generous
on purpose: 160 is brisk and usually known, 190 has stopped leaving room for a
thought to land). **A verdict belongs in code, not in the model's head.**

The line appears only when `sampled` reaches `DELIVERY_MIN_SAMPLE_S` (20 s),
because 200 wpm off twelve seconds of talk is noise, and the prompt makes the
line's presence the condition for a `pace` hint – so the model cannot invent
numbers it was not given:

```
delivery: 272 wpm (very-fast) · 7 fillers in the last 46s spoken · longest silence 0s
delivery: 132 wpm (easy) · no fillers counted in the last 74s spoken (a recogniser often drops them) · longest silence 3s
```

**Two honest cautions, both in the prompt and one in the line itself.**
Chrome's recogniser frequently **strips filler sounds** before a final result
is ever delivered, so a count of zero is not evidence that none were said – the
line says so where the number is, and no hint may read a zero as fluency. And
the filler set is deliberately **conservative: sounds, never words.** `ähm äh
ehm öhm hm hmm uh uhm um erm` with the repetitions a recogniser writes
("ähhh", "ummm"); `also`, `halt`, `eigentlich`, `like` and `you know` are
ordinary speech and are not counted, because a false positive tells a lecturer
to stop doing something they were not doing, which is unanswerable. `er` is
left out although it is an English filler, because in German it is the word
"he" – and **`um` counts only where the language is not German**, where it is an
everyday preposition ("um die Ecke"). That is the one place the count needs to
know the language, which is why the sidecar puts `lang` in the session.

## The policy, as coded

`createPolicy(opts)` returns `{judge, shown, dismissed, forgetStanding, rebase,
standing, history}`.
`judge(answer, ctx)` answers `{show: true}` or `{show: false, reason}`, and the
reason is what the log is read for afterwards. `ctx` is `{now, elapsedSinceOn,
chunkId, cueTargets, timeHintAllowed}` – two clocks, because switching the
prompter on mid-talk should still buy the speaker a quiet minute.

| rule | as coded | reason |
|---|---|---|
| more than `MAX_WORDS` = 12 words | discarded, never shortened | `too-long` |
| opening silence | `startQuiet` 60 s, measured from the switch | `start-quiet` |
| one hint at a time | while one stands, a `low` one is dropped; a `high` one replaces it | `standing` |
| cool-down overall | `cooldown` (frontmatter, default 20 s), with one exception: `fact` at `high`. It stops two whispers landing on top of one another and nothing more. It was 60 s, which made it shorter than every per-kind figure below and therefore the only gate most answers ever met: in the first real rehearsal one fact correction swallowed both clock warnings behind it, and a clock warning repeats nothing a number said | `cooldown` |
| per kind | `time` 240 s · `delivery` 300 s and at most 3 per session · `pace` 150 s and at most 4 · `skipped` 90 s · `fact` 45 s · `example` no cool-down but one per slide | `kind-cooldown`, `delivery-max`, `pace-max`, `example-per-chunk` |
| | `pace` has a figure of its own precisely so that it shares one with nothing: tempo is a condition that lasts minutes and comes back, while manner is a moment. In the author's first rehearsal one cool-down doing every job was what made the prompter speak twice out of nine. Two and a half minutes is about how long it takes a speaker who has been told to slow down to have actually changed something; four in a talk is the ceiling, one more than `delivery`, because the condition genuinely recurs | |
| | `skipped` is the shortest figure after `fact`, because two omissions on two slides are two different facts – but not shorter, because a speaker who has left a slide cannot go back to it and a second reminder about the same one is noise | |
| | `fact` was 120 s. A speaker with the figures muddled misleads the room once per attempt, and *repeating the same words* is what the duplicate rule refuses – which it does whether this figure is generous or not. Replaying the first rehearsal moved four whispers through instead of two, and every remaining refusal became a duplicate rather than a timer | |
| duplicates | word Jaccard ≥ 0.6 against every hint shown **or dismissed** | `duplicate` |
| a clock hint | only when `timeHintAllowed` said yes | `time-not-allowed` |
| a cue | only an id from `cue_targets`, at most one per slide | `bad-cue`, `cue-per-chunk` |
| anything malformed | `parseAnswer` already turned it into `nothing` – including a hint or a card whose text or slide id carries a control character (`\p{Cc}`) after the whitespace is folded; the refusal carries the text with them shown as `U+FFFD` | `garbage` |
| a tool call cut off mid-JSON | the same, under its own name, because the cure is a number in this file and not a different model. `choices[0].finish_reason === 'length'` is what tells them apart, and a run of five says so in its own words on the badge | `truncated` |

**A cue is not a hint.** It goes into a slide that is still to come, nobody reads
it now, so it takes no part in the standing slot, the overall cool-down or the
per-kind cool-downs; `bad-cue` and `cue-per-chunk` are its own. It is still
subject to the three rules that are about the words rather than about the
strip: `too-long`, `start-quiet` and `duplicate` – a card is read by the same
eye during the same talk. The policy is made **once**
and kept across rebuilds, because a save in the middle of a talk must not hand
the speaker the same hint a second time.

Only nonsense counts towards the garbage streak (`garbage`, `truncated`, `too-long`,
`bad-cue`); a policy that swallows a well-formed hint is the policy working.

**Nothing is recorded until the whisper has left the socket.** `policy.shown`
is what takes the standing slot, starts the cool-downs and locks a slide
against a second card, and the sidecar calls it only when `sendToCockpit`
returned true; a failed send is logged as `suppressed` with the reason
`no-cockpit` and nothing else happens. Recording a hint no screen ever had
made the policy refuse everything after it for something the speaker never
saw.

**The standing slot can age out, and that is the second half of the same
defence.** Every way a hint leaves the strip sends a `dismiss`, so in the
ordinary course `standingMax` (an option of `createPolicy`, default 40 s –
the cockpit's `high` fade of 25 s plus a margin) is never reached. It is there
for the dismissal that cannot arrive: the socket closed under the hint, or the
page reloaded, which a `--watch` rebuild does on every save. `standing(now)`
treats anything older as gone – it keeps its place in the history and in the
duplicate rule, because it was said – and `forgetStanding()` is the explicit
version the sidecar calls from every `hello`. Without either, one lost
dismissal dropped every `low` hint for the rest of the talk under the reason
`standing`, which in the log reads exactly like the policy working.

## The drift rule

`driftSeconds({elapsed, marks, idx, beat, durationS, chunkCount})` returns
`{drift, rough, beforeFirst}` or `null`; positive is behind.

- With `@mm:ss` marks, the reference is the **last mark the talk has passed**,
  and before the first mark it is that first one – the same rule `cueDriftRef`
  uses, so the cockpit's own drift and the prompter's agree. A mark carries its
  beat (`{at, beat}` per chunk, flattened with the `idx` by `flattenMarks`),
  because a mark means nothing without the point in the talk it names.
- **`beforeFirst` says that reference is a mark the talk has not reached**, and
  then the number is only half a fact. With the first mark at 12:30 on slide 3 –
  the natural way to write them – a speaker on slide 1 at 1:05 is 685 seconds
  "ahead" of a clock nobody has arrived at, and the prompter was invited to
  whisper about it on the first tick after the opening quiet. The number is kept,
  because being *past* that mark's time while still on slide 1 is genuinely
  behind; what the flag closes is the *ahead* branch of `timeHintAllowed`. The
  state line says so where the number is (`drift -685s ahead (of the first mark,
  not reached yet)`), the way the cockpit's own drift shows it grey and
  labelled. Decks here start at `@0:00`, so `spoken-talk` never shows it.
- With no marks but a `duration:`, the plan is a straight line through the
  slides – `durationS × idx / chunkCount` – and says so with `rough: true`.
- With neither, `null`, and a prompter with no plan has nothing to say about the
  clock.

`timeHintAllowed({drift, rough, beforeFirst, lastTimeHint, elapsed})`: at least 90 s behind
(180 s on the rough estimate, which is wrong by construction on any deck whose
slides differ), and after a first time hint either 60 s more drift or five
minutes; or at least 240 s ahead, at most once every ten minutes. Behind is
worth more than ahead: a talk running long has to lose something, and that is a
decision only worth offering while there is still something to lose.

## Failure modes – silence plus one badge, never a modal

The badge is `#psiINT-souffleuse-badge`, a `.cmd-badge` painted as `PROMPTER · <text>`,
and it appears only when something is degraded.

| case | behaviour | what the badge says |
|---|---|---|
| no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | sidecar `disabled`, console once, `hello` says so; the transcript is still logged | `off – no OPENROUTER_API_KEY in the environment` |
| 401 / 403 | `disable`, and no retries – a refused key is refused on every one. The switch cannot undo it either: `setEnabled(true)` refuses while `disabled` and the toggle answers `{on: false, enabled: false}` | `off – OpenRouter refused the key (HTTP 401) – restart the watcher with a corrected key`, because the key is read once, from the watcher's environment |
| 429 / 5xx / network | backoff 30 s, 60 s, 120 s; `status error` meanwhile | `HTTP 500 – fake outage; trying again in 30s` – the body's own `error.message` and `error.code` ride along, because `HTTP 400` alone sends an author looking at their network when the id is mistyped |
| a 200 carrying `{error}` and no `choices` | the same as a 5xx: `trouble`, backoff, the message on the badge. It used to reach `parseAnswer`, which found neither a tool call nor content and answered `garbage` – so a model out of credits read in the debrief like a model talking nonsense | `the model answered with an error – upstream is out of credits (code 402); trying again in 30s` |
| five such failures in a row | `disable` for this build | `off – 5 failed or timed-out calls in a row – last: …` |
| timeout at 8 s | logged as `error: timeout` with its `streak`, and **no backoff** – the answer merely missed its sentence. It does count towards the five: an endpoint that never answers in time is paid for on every call and helps with none. An abort that is not the timer (the switch, the watcher going away) is logged as `aborted` and counts for nothing | – (returns to `listening`) |
| the hour's calls spent (`calls-per-hour`) | no tick until the oldest call of the last sixty minutes ages out; said once, as a `warn` line and a status | `360 calls in the last hour, the budget in prompter: {calls-per-hour} – quiet for about N min` |
| five unusable answers in a row | `status error`, nothing disabled | `5 unusable answers in a row from <model>` |
| socket gone when switching on | the switch stays off | `off – the watch socket is not connected`, or `off – no answer from the watch server` – the two strings `psiWatch.ask` really yields, one for a socket that is not open and one for a reply that never came |
| no `webkitSpeechRecognition` | the switch stays off | `no speech recognition in this browser` |
| microphone denied | the switch goes off with it | `microphone denied – allow it in the address bar` |
| no microphone | switch off | `no microphone` |
| recognition ends six times in a minute | switch off; restarting it for the rest of the talk holds the microphone light on for nothing | `recognition keeps stopping` |
| recognition loses the network, or errors | the ear restarts itself underneath the badge, and **the next final result it hears takes the badge down again** (`souffEarRecovered`) – a condition that passes must not leave its sentence standing over a working prompter | `speech recognition lost the network` / `… stopped with an error` |
| server recognition instead of on-device | the quiet one: whatever is left when nothing louder stands | `server speech recognition` |

**The badge needs a memory.** A status arrives on every tick, and a version that
wrote the badge directly wiped a refused key's reason one message later – the
`idle` answering the cockpit's own switch-off took it down at exactly the moment
a lecturer looks for it. So the ear keeps one reason (`souffEarWhy`) and the
sidecar another (`souffSideWhy`), and `souffPaintBadge` paints from the pair.

## The log

`prompter-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.jsonl` beside `source.md`, one per run of the
watcher, created mode `0o600` through `appendOutputFile` – it holds the room's
words – like `prompter-<hash>.prompt.txt` through `writeOutputFile`. `--serve`
refuses both, by name. Every line carries `t` and `type`:

| type | body |
|---|---|
| `session` | `via` (`build` / `hello`), `model`, `base`, `prefixHash`, `prefixChars`, `chunkCount`, `lang`, `durationS`, `cadence`, `cooldown`, `cues`, `stt`, `disabled`. `stt` carries `engine`, `local`, and – from the hello – `onDevice`, Chrome's verdict for each spelling of the language that was tried (`en: downloadable`, `en-US: available`), plus `installing`, the tag a download was actually asked for. Without those two the log could not say why a machine with the model installed was still talking to a server |
| `say` | `text`, `t0`, `t1`, `chunkId`, `idx`, `beat` |
| `move` | `idx`, `chunkId`, `sentId`, `beat`, `elapsed` |
| `tick` | `reason`, `idx`, `chunkId`, `beat`, `elapsed`, `drift`, `rough`, `timeHintAllowed`, `cueTargets`, and the **user message** – never the prefix, which is the same 20 to 60 KB on every line and is already in the build |
| `answer` | the raw body, `usage`, `durationMs`; under `--prompter-dry-run`, `{dryRun: true}` and nothing else |
| `hint` / `cue` | what went out, including the model's `why`, which is for the log alone |
| `suppressed` | `reason` plus the answer the policy refused – this is the half of the debrief that says what the model wanted to say. Two reasons are not the policy's: `no-cockpit`, the whisper that was ready with no socket to put it on, and `stale-deck`, a card for a slide the build that landed while the call was out no longer has (`cueTargets` was computed against the deck of the tick; the alternative was a card replayed into every reloaded cockpit under a dead id until the next build's `cue-dropped` sweep) |
| `dismiss` | `hintId`, `how` |
| `prefs` | `cues`, `ceiling` – the cue checkbox changed in the cockpit |
| `status`, `error` | every transition with the cockpit clock it happened on (`elapsed` – the replay measures the opening quiet from the `listening` the switch wrote, and nothing else in the log says when it was thrown), and every failure with its streak |
| `clock` | the cockpit's clock went backwards and everything was moved onto the new one: `delta`, `was`, `now`, the new `onAt`, and how many transcript segments were older than the new zero |
| `warn` | something the sidecar carried on through and a person should know: today, only a slide index past the end of the deck |
| `cue-dropped` | a card whose slide this build no longer has |

**Beside it, one file per build whose deck changed:**
`prompter-<prefixHash>.prompt.txt`, the system prefix exactly as it is sent.
It is 20 to 60 KB and would otherwise be on every `tick` line or nowhere at
all; one file per hash is the same text once, named by the hash the `session`
line and `session_id` carry. Gitignored beside the JSONL, and the start banner
names it.

**Where it lies is a caution, not only a fact.** The log holds the spoken words
verbatim, and it is written beside `source.md` wherever that is – which is
where it is worth having, because the debrief belongs with the deck it is
about. This repository's `.gitignore` covers `prompter-*.jsonl` and
`lectures/*/prompter-*.jsonl` (plus the pre-rename `souffleuse-*` spellings)
**and nothing else**: a lecture written in a
content repo of its own is one `git add -A` away from committing a transcript
of a rehearsal, so that repo needs the same pattern. `--new` scaffolds no
`.gitignore` to put it in, so the sidecar prints the log's full path and says
so on every start, and the README's privacy paragraph repeats it.

**Everything printed goes through `terminalSafe`**, which replaces control
characters and bidi overrides with spaces: a model's words and an endpoint's
error both reach the terminal, and an escape sequence in either is an
instruction to it. `--prompter-replay` prints through it too, because a log is
a file somebody may have sent along with a deck.

**What the terminal hears, beside the states.** One line for the first answer
of a run – `first answer in 1.4 s · 4096 of 4211 prompt tokens cached`, read
off `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` and `usage.prompt_tokens`, or
`no cache figures in the reply` when the endpoint sends none – because those
are the two questions a rehearsal is read for and both are decided by the
second call. And one line for every suppressed answer the model meant
something by: `held back (cooldown): "name the bank example"`. A plain
`nothing` is not one of those; the test is whether the answer carries words,
because `too-long` and `bad-cue` come out of `parseAnswer` as a `nothing`
already. Without it, a prompter that has wanted to say six things and been
refused six times looks from the outside exactly like a prompter with nothing
to say.

`--events` carries the same transitions as `{type: 'prompter', state, …}`:
`ready` / `off` after a build (with `model`, `session`, `chunks`), `listening`,
`thinking`, `idle`, `error` with a `why`, `hint` with `kind` and `severity`,
`cue` with `chunkId`. The stdin command `{"type":"prompter","enabled":false}`
is the same switch the cockpit's button throws. The terminal hears only the
states a person would want to be told about: `listening` and `thinking`
alternate once per tick, which on a 45-minute talk is a hundred lines through
the middle of the log the author is reading.

## The cockpit

Everything is `souffleuse-*`, because the cockpit's element ids share one
namespace with the lecture's chunk ids and no slide will ever want that word –
the visible word is `prompter`. `#psiINT-souffleuse-btn` (footer switch, `Shift`-`S`
through `viewHooks.onShiftS`, `Shift`-click opens the history),
`#psiINT-souffleuse-badge`, `#psiINT-souffleuse-strip` with `.souffleuse-glyph`,
`.souffleuse-text` and `.souffleuse-x`, `#psiINT-souffleuse-heard`, `#psiINT-souffleuse-log`
with `#psiINT-souffleuse-log-list`, `#psiINT-souffleuse-heard-toggle` and
`#psiINT-souffleuse-cues-toggle`, and `.cue-added` inside a card the prompter laid. The pieces of the panel are looked up **through the
panel**, not through the global id map. Two more places carry the prompter only
under the flag: the footer's key crib gains `Shift-S prompter`, and the help
overlay gains the group *The prompter* – **first** in the speaker list, with
its privacy row as its first row. Measured at 1440×900, that panel is three
screens tall and scrolls, and in fifth place the whole group began 200 px
below the fold.

- **The strip is one element in two homes**, like the clock: absolutely
  positioned over the bottom edge of `#psiINT-stage-cell` in the classic arrangement,
  inside `#psiINT-cue-panel` immediately above `#psiINT-cue-rail` under `K`. `cuePlaceStrip`
  moves it and the interim line together and looks both up by id.
  `SOUFFLEUSE_JS` **wraps** `applyCueMode` rather than putting a call inside
  it, the way it chains the two `viewHooks` – a cockpit without a prompter has
  nothing to move – and then runs `cuePlaceStrip(cueOn())` once itself, because
  the cue section restored the saved arrangement before this text existed.
  `#psiINT-cue-rail { position: relative }` lives in `SOUFFLEUSE_CSS` for the same
  reason: `cueRender` scrolls to `curEl.offsetTop`, and the strip is the only
  thing that ever grows above the rail.
- Glyphs: `◷` time, `◇` example, `△` fact, `◌` delivery, `≫` pace, `⋯` skipped, `▤` cue. `high` is red
  like `#psiINT-center-toast.warn`. Auto-fade 15 s, 25 s for `high`, and the fade is a
  dismissal (`how: 'fade'`). **A card carries its own figure**: the arrival
  announcement passes `fade: 30000` and the receipt `fade: 6000`, because a
  hint is glanced at and a card is read – and in the classic layout the strip
  is the only place the card's words stand at all, the history panel apart.
- **Esc**: `viewHooks.escapePrompter` runs after the help panel and the address
  overlay and before a text selection – the history panel first if it is open,
  otherwise the standing hint. It returns whether it took something, so the chain
  carries on when it did not.
- **Switching on is two awaits long** – asking the browser about the recogniser,
  then the hello – and `souffOn` is only true at the end of it, so `souffStarting`
  guards the window in between and is cleared in a `finally`. Without it a second
  press, or the `sessionStorage` restore arriving beside a click, walked past the
  guard and opened a second recogniser, whose finals all arrived twice; the
  adapter's `start()` now aborts an open one as the guard a caller cannot forget.
- **A card that lands is acknowledged on the strip** for six seconds – `▤ card
  for <the slide's cue title>`, low severity, and never over a hint that is
  standing, because what stands was judged worth interrupting a sentence for
  and this is not. It has a `cueId` and no `hintId`, so sending it away stays
  local. Without it the only sign that the prompter had done anything was a
  card in a slide the speaker had not walked to yet. `souffCueAdd` also puts a
  row in the history for every card, whether it arrived on the socket or came
  back with a `hello`, so a run that laid four cards and whispered nothing no
  longer reads as a run in which nothing happened. **One row per card, and at
  the time the card was laid.** The Map lives in this window alone, so a reload
  – or unticking the cue box and ticking it back – empties it and the sidecar
  replays what it has; a replay used to enter the card a second time, stamped
  with the clock it was replayed on, and a real talk showed one card at 5:55
  and again at 7:33 for one cue sent once. So `souffleuse-cue` and the
  `cueCards` of a `hello` both carry `at`, and the ids already in the record
  are kept apart from the rows, which are capped at ten. The arrival
  announcement in the classic layout enters no row at all – the card is already
  one – and its own once-per-card set is per page, which is left alone: the
  announcement is owed to the speaker the first time they walk onto the slide,
  a fresh page cannot know whether they already did, and showing a card that is
  genuinely on the slide in front of them twice is cheaper than never showing
  it.
- **The first switch-on of a tab says where the words go**: `prompter listening
  · on-device · text goes to openrouter.ai`, one line, and the short form after
  that (`psi-slides:souffleuse-told`). The ear is only half of the consent – the
  recogniser may well run on this machine while the transcript does not stay on
  it – and under `--prompter-dry-run` the same line says `dry run, nothing
  leaves this machine`, which is why the `hello` reply carries `dryRun`.
  **Each half is said only where it is true**: the recogniser is Chrome's, and
  off the device it sends the audio to Google, dry run or not. So the four
  toasts are `text goes to openrouter.ai` (on-device), `audio to Google, text
  to openrouter.ai`, `dry run, nothing leaves this machine` (on-device only)
  and `dry run, audio to Google for recognition, nothing to a model`. The
  help row, the terminal banners and the README say the same: the prompter
  sends no audio; Chrome's recognition does, unless it runs on the device.
- **Storage**: `sessionStorage psi-slides:souffleuse` (on, so a `--watch` reload
  does not need the switch pressed again – and *not* `localStorage`, because the
  microphone is an act of consent and the button is where it is given; an `off`
  or `idle` from the sidecar drops it, so a switch somebody threw is not undone
  by the next reload);
  `sessionStorage psi-slides:souffleuse-clock` (the cockpit's `tStart`, written
  whenever the consent is written and after a click on `#psiINT-clock`, restored on
  load only when the consent is there and the value is neither in the future
  nor twelve hours old – see *Traps*);
  `sessionStorage psi-slides:souffleuse-onat` (the switch-on moment on that
  clock, written beside it and read back **only on the restore path**: the
  opening quiet is measured from the press, and re-stamping it on every
  `--watch` reload showed the heard-words line for another minute and said the
  prompter could not help yet through a minute in which it could, while the
  sidecar – which keeps its own stamp and rebases it – correctly did not
  re-quiet. A stored value in the new clock's future is a clock somebody
  restarted, and then the minute is owed again);
  `sessionStorage psi-slides:souffleuse-told` (the long toast has been said once);
  `localStorage psi-slides:souffleuse-heard` and `psi-slides:souffleuse-cues`
  (preferences of a person, not of a tab).
- **Cues**: `souffleuseCues`, a `Map` of chunk id → `[{cueId, text}]`, is
  declared up in the cue-cards section – it and the merge below are the two
  pieces of the prompter an ordinary cockpit carries, because the rail is drawn
  from them – and read by `cueCardsFor`, which appends
  each card on beat 0 as `{bullets: [text], souffleuse: true}`; `cueRender` draws
  it as `.cue-card.souffleuse`. In the classic layout, which has no rail,
  `souffCueOnArrival` shows the same card once as a strip hint of kind `cue` –
  with a null `hintId`, so that dismissal stays local: the sidecar filed a card
  for a slide, not a hint on a strip. Its index guard is what makes that one
  card per arrival rather than one per call, and the `late` argument is the one
  caller allowed past it: the `souffleuse-cue` handler, when the card names the
  slide already up. Without that the receipt named the slide under the
  speaker's own feet – see the race below, now closed.
- **Where the talk is** comes from `souffWhere`, and the beat is
  `cuePosition(entry).consumed` – the number of presses the slide has taken,
  which is what a cue card is filed under, what `::: overlay from N` counts and
  what `deckPayload` numbered the beats by. A second walk of the same DOM is how
  the two halves come to disagree about which beat a sentence was said on. The
  clock sent with it is `souffClock()`, the same origin as `elapsedSeconds()`
  but unrounded to two decimals: four fifths of a second of speech is not zero
  seconds of speech, and the cadence is counted in those. `souffleuse-move`
  also carries `beats`, which is `cuePosition(entry).total` – the second half
  of the state line's `beat 2/3`. It exists in the cockpit's DOM and nowhere
  else: two of three is a slide nearly done and two of nine is a slide barely
  begun, and without it the model reads the same sentence for both.

### The line under the strip does two jobs

`#psiINT-souffleuse-heard` is one element with two roles, and the switch between them
is the opening quiet, which the `hello` reply carries as `startQuiet`.

**For the first minute after the switch** it shows the words the ear is
picking up, with no checkbox touched (`souffOpeningQuiet`). That minute is
exactly the one in which the prompter cannot say anything at all, and it is
therefore the one in which a speaker wonders whether the thing is working. The
words stop when the quiet ends; leaving them up for a whole talk is a moving
line in the corner of the eye, which is what `#psiINT-souffleuse-heard-toggle` is for
when somebody wants it anyway.

**After that the same line is the heartbeat** (`.beat`, `souffBeatText`):
`listening`, then `asking the model…` while a call is out, then
`asked 18s ago · 4 so far`. It drops the italic and takes the mono face,
because it is chrome and not something anybody said. The counter comes from
the `thinking` status, which is the one moment the cockpit can see that the
whole chain is alive. **This exists because the correct behaviour of this
feature is silence**, and silence is indistinguishable from a prompter that
died twenty minutes ago; the speaker who asked for it had been opening the
history panel to check.

### The language it assumed, said out loud

`souffLangTag` is the tag recognition actually runs in, and it is **not
necessarily the one the deck wrote**: `available()` resolves `lang: de` to the
`de-DE` model that is installed, and `souffStt.start` is then handed that tag.
Resolving it for the availability question and listening under the deck's
spelling was a real defect - it found the on-device model and then did not use
it.

`souffLangName()` names it through `Intl.DisplayNames`, from the primary subtag
so that the region is not said twice, and keeps the tag beside it because the
tag is what identifies the model: **Deutsch (de-DE)**. It appears at the moment
of consent, in the switch-on toast (`prompter listening · Deutsch (de-DE) ·
on-device`), and on the switch's own `title` for the rest of the talk, since
the toast is gone in two seconds.

Why it earns the room: a German talk heard as English yields a transcript of
plausible nonsense, the model dutifully corrects the nonsense, and nothing on
the screen says which of the two is wrong. It is the one thing a speaker can be
wrong about without noticing.

### A card the prompter laid says so

`.cue-card.souffleuse` already had the dashed track, the hollow ring and the
italic, which say *not yours* to a reader who knows the rail. It now also
carries `.cue-added`, a small-caps line reading **added while you spoke**, in
the deck's own `--emph`. The line style is for the tenth time it happens; the
words are for the first, mid-talk, when nobody is in the mood to infer
anything from a border. The label is generated in `cueRender`, which lives in
the unconditional half of `SPEAKER_JS` beside the `cueCardsFor` merge - one
line and no stylesheet, since a plain cockpit never has such a card - while
the rule that paints it sits in `SOUFFLEUSE_CSS` with the rest.

## The STT adapter

```
{ name,
  needsDownload(),
  available(lang) -> Promise<{ok, local, why}>,
  download(lang),                       // only from inside a click
  start(lang, {onFinal, onInterim, onState}, onDevice),
  stop() }
```

`onFinal({text, t0, t1})` in seconds of the cockpit's clock; `onState` reports
`denied`, `no-mic`, `stalled`, `network` or `error` – the first three take the
switch with them, because a listening light over a dead ear is worse than no
light. The Web Speech implementation sets `continuous` and `interimResults`,
tries the on-device path (`SpeechRecognition.available({langs, processLocally:
true})`, `install()` from inside the click because the download wants a gesture,
`rec.processLocally = true`), and treats anything that is not a plain
`available` as a reason to fall back to server recognition with the badge up
rather than to argue. `no-speech` and `aborted` are the ordinary course of a talk
and not failures; `end` restarts, capped at six per minute.

**A segment's `t0` is where the speaking started, and that is load-bearing.**
The API gives a result no start time, so the adapter takes it from
`speechstart`, falling back to the first interim after a final where that event
does not arrive, and to the end of the last final (re-stamped on every restart)
where neither does. It used to be the end of the previous final outright, which
put the pause between two sentences *inside* `t1 - t0`: `longestGap` was
structurally 0, a sentence after a minute of thinking was rated at about ten
words a minute, `sampled` reached its twenty-second floor on silence alone, and
the cadence counted the quiet as speech. `t1 - t0` is the number the cadence and
every delivery figure are counted in, so it has to be speech.

**A Node adapter plugs in without a protocol change.** `sidecar.say(segment)` is
the same door a socket `say` comes through, so a whisper.cpp on `PATH` (the
`cwebp` pattern) or a hosted recogniser becomes a second producer of the same
`{text, t0, t1}` shape inside Node; the cockpit then reports `hello {stt:
{engine: 'node'}}` and stops sending its own segments. Nothing calls it in v1,
and the shape it takes is the reason the protocol does not have to change when
something does.

## What the tests cover, and what neither can

**`test/gates/souffleuse.mjs`** (188 assertions; in the gate suite, no browser,
no `npm install`): `deckPayload` against a hand-built `lecture` object of the shape
`parseLecture` returns – built in the file, so a re-worded lecture cannot fail a
compiler gate – prefix stability and the hash, `tickMessage` (`NEW`, the window,
`cue_targets`, the `✕`), `parseAnswer` (tool call, content fallback, a fenced
object, garbage, thirteen words, a cue on the active slide), **every row of the
policy table**, `driftSeconds` at each of its references, `timeHintAllowed`,
`shouldTick`, **the standing slot ageing out at `standingMax`**, the export
list, the absence of imports and Node APIs, and that `TOOL_SCHEMA` is generated
from `KINDS` and `SEVERITIES` rather than restated. Since the adversarial
review also: a clock that went backwards (`shouldTick` with a negative gap, and
`rebaseClock` at each of its branches), a refusal carrying the evidence it
refused, a Chinese hint of 38 characters discarded and one of ten whispered,
and `replayAnswers` over an inline log. Since the delivery work: `speechStats`
(a rate over spoken seconds where the wall clock would have said less than half
of it, the filler set with the repetitions a recogniser writes, `um` counted in
English and not in German, `also` / `like` / `er` / `ah` counted nowhere,
`longestGap`, an empty window answering null rather than Infinity),
`paceVerdict` at each of its four boundaries, the delivery line present and
absent around `DELIVERY_MIN_SAMPLE_S`, the zero-filler sentence carrying its own
caveat, `cueTargets` with a `closing:` chunk and without one, and the two new
cool-downs with their ceilings counted apart. Since the third correctness
review: the two stampings of one stretch of talk side by side (from the end of
the previous final, which reports the wall-clock rate and a longest silence of
zero, and from the start of speech, which reports a rate, a silence and a
sample), `beforeFirst` at both of its references with the *ahead* branch of
`timeHintAllowed` closed on it and *behind* still counting, the state line
saying so where the number is, and `policy.rebase` – the refusal that outlived
a restarted clock, the ages surviving the move, the history rows moving exactly
once because the standing hint is one of them, and a delta of nothing moving
nothing.

**`test/souffleuse.mjs`** (113 assertions; the browser suite, the ninth spec that
builds a deck of its own): a real `node build.js … --watch --serve --prompter --events`
child, a fake OpenRouter on loopback reached through `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`, and a
fake `webkitSpeechRecognition` installed with `addInitScript`. It asserts the
switch and its `sessionStorage`, the request body (`cache_control`, the forced
`advise`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `reasoning.effort`, `session_id`, the state
line, `NEW`), the hint on the strip with its glyph and severity, `Esc` reaching
the JSONL as a `dismiss … esc`, a slide tick becoming a card in a later slide –
shown as a strip hint in the classic layout and as `.cue-card.souffleuse` under
`K`, a card whose answer is held until the speaker has walked onto its slide – a `nothing` that reaches no screen, an HTTP 500 becoming a badge and not a
dialog, **that `speaker.html` never contains the string `OPENROUTER`**, and that
the projection has none of the chrome and no field of `snapshot()` is the
prompter's. Since the code review it also asserts the seven things that review
found: two presses in one task start one recogniser, a bare `hello` switches
nothing on, a `{"type":"prompter","enabled":false}` written to the child's
stdin stops the ear and clears the consent without sending a dismissal for the
hint it took away, one press brings it back, a reload mid-hint does not lock the
policy and replays the cards already laid, unticking the cue box empties
`cue_targets`, a build of the same deck **without** the flag carries none of the
prompter (36 KB lighter), and `--prompter-model` on its own is a usage error
rather than a silent ordinary build. **It moves the clock rather than waiting it out**: `__stt.final(text,
70)` pushes the cockpit's `tStart` back seventy seconds, so the opening quiet and
the cadence happen at once and the whole spec is about eleven seconds. Since the
adversarial review it also has the model id and the tool name in
the body, one prefix text identical across every call of the session (the cache
assumption, which no single request can show), a real `@0:00` mark so the drift
is not `(rough)`, the clock surviving a reload, the acknowledgement a landed
card puts on the strip and the row it puts in the history, a 200 carrying
`{error}` reaching the badge and the log as the sentence it is, and a second
cockpit taking the prompter with the first one switched off rather than left
listening into nothing. Since the delivery work: a stretch of talk at 288 wpm
with two filler sounds in it reaching the request body as one delivery line, the
`pace` hint that comes back painted under `≫`, a card laid into the deck's
`closing:` chunk while the speaker stands four slides away, and – after a reload
and again after the cue box is unticked and ticked – **one history row for that
card, carrying the clock it was laid on** rather than one row per replay. Its
fixture deck is seven slides for that last reason: the conclusion has to sit
beyond the next-three window to prove anything.

Since the third correctness review the fake ear also has `__stt.utterance(text,
pause, spoken, how)` – quiet, then the ear noticing that words have started,
then the clock running while the sentence is said, which `final` cannot model
because it moves the clock and fires in the same breath. Both spellings of the
evidence are driven (`speechstart`, and an interim alone for a recogniser that
sends none), and the assertion is the one the tautological one should have
been: **the segment is shorter than the wall gap in front of it.** It fails
against the old stamp, where the gap was 0 and the span was the whole pause.
Four seconds of speech and seven words each, deliberately under the cadence, so
that the queue of scripted answers stays aligned with the ticks above it.

Neither can say: recognition quality, whether the on-device path is really
available (the fake claims it), whether the prompt cache is warm, or whether the
model is restrained. Two more the spec cannot say: the snapshot is asserted to
carry no field whose *name* mentions the prompter, which is not a proof that no
value ever rides in one; and the auto-fade of a standing hint is left alone,
because 15 and 25 s of real time are worth more than the assertion. For all of
those, the log and a rehearsal.

## Traps recorded the hard way

- **`duration: 45:00` is a sexagesimal integer to YAML 1.1**, which is what
  gray-matter speaks: it arrives as `2700`. `parseLecture` restores the string
  the author wrote from the raw frontmatter rather than requiring quotes, so
  `talkDuration` sees a clock. The linter never saw the number and needed
  nothing – but it does need the same *shape*: the restore once took two digits
  before the first colon where `talkDuration` and `lint.js` took three, so
  `duration: 120:00` linted clean, arrived as `7200` and was refused as a talk
  of 7200 minutes. One constant now, `TALK_CLOCK_SRC`, read by the restore and
  by `talkDuration`, with the same literal mirrored by hand in `lint.js`.
- **The `hello` reply cannot carry its own `why`** (above). The reason rides in
  the protocol's `why`, with `ok: true`.
- **`souffleuseCues` is a `const` in another section for a reason.** Declared
  beside the prompter's own code, the cue mode's restore – which runs earlier –
  reached it in its temporal dead zone, inside the `try` that guards
  `localStorage`, which swallowed the throw whole. The same trap the cue mode's
  own restore was moved down for, seen from the other side.
- **`#psiINT-cue-rail` is `position: relative` under the flag.** `cueRender` scrolls to
  `curEl.offsetTop`, measured against whatever positioned ancestor happened to be
  up the tree, so the strip growing above the rail moved every card by its own
  height. The rule is in `SOUFFLEUSE_CSS`, not `SPEAKER_CSS`.
- **The runtime and its stylesheet used to ride in every `speaker.html`.**
  36 KB of prompter in a file nothing could reach it from, while the comment in
  `renderSpeaker` promised the opposite. They are `SOUFFLEUSE_CSS` and
  `SOUFFLEUSE_JS` now, spliced only under the flag – but **inside the same
  `<style>` and the same `<script>`**, because the runtime lives in
  `SPEAKER_JS`'s lexical scope and a script element of its own would give it
  nothing but `undefined`.
- **A comment naming the environment variable shipped it into the page.** The
  spec's `OPENROUTER` assertion failed on a comment in `SPEAKER_JS` quoting the
  badge text. Reworded rather than the assertion weakened: a privacy check that
  has to allow exceptions is not one. Do not write the variable's name inside
  `SPEAKER_JS`, not even in a comment.
- **The cockpit's clock is the page load, and the page reloads on every save.**
  `tStart` is a `let` in `SPEAKER_JS`, and a `--watch` rebuild reloads the
  cockpit – so a rehearsal's clock went back to 0:00 mid-talk and the sidecar
  believed it. The origin is kept in `sessionStorage` **only while the prompter
  is on**, because a cockpit opened while the room fills is meant to start at
  0:00 and the clock button is how a speaker says the talk has begun. The
  prompter's own click listener on `#psiINT-clock` is added after the cockpit's, so
  `tStart` is already the new one when it re-writes the key. Everything the
  sidecar does about it is in `rebaseClock`, and both halves are needed: the
  sidecar must not believe a clock it did not set, whatever page it is talking
  to.
- **A rebase only helps where the old clock is the one that died.**
  `rebaseClock` (and `policy.rebase` beside it) rests on the sidecar's
  `onAtElapsed` and its cool-downs being stamped on the clock that went
  backwards. The other direction is not covered and cannot be: a **fresh
  sidecar** meeting an **old page** – the watcher restarted, the page not
  reloaded, which is reachable now that a refused reconnect switches the
  cockpit off and the speaker presses again – has `onAtElapsed` near 0 while
  the cockpit's clock reads 25:00. Nothing drops, so no rebase fires, and the
  fresh policy has no history at all: a hint already whispered in the first
  half of the talk can come back word for word. Not fixable without persisting
  the policy across processes, which a rehearsal tool does not earn.
- **The cue race in the classic layout, closed.** A card that arrives while the
  speaker is already walking onto its slide was shown by `cueSync` in the rail,
  but `souffCueOnArrival` had marked that slide as seen on the way through – so
  the classic arrangement got the receipt, `card for …`, naming the slide under
  the speaker's own feet, and never the card's words. The handler now asks
  `souffCueOnArrival(true)` when the card names the slide already up, and falls
  back to the receipt only when it declines. **Staging it needs a call held in
  flight**, because the policy refuses a cue for the current slide: the card has
  to be asked for from the slide before, and the speaker has to move while the
  answer is out. `fakeOpenRouter`'s `hold` is that – a step whose answer waits
  until the spec says the page has moved. The first attempt at a spec here
  polled the log rather than `souffleuseCues` in the page, passed three times
  and then did not, which is how the race was found in the first place; a
  sleep-and-hope spec would have been the same bug again.
