// The diagram compiler, and the one part of the rendering stack that has to
// run in two places.
//
// `build.js` is deliberately one file – the whole rendering stack, parser,
// renderers, CSS and runtime JS. This module is the documented exception,
// and the reason is narrow: the graphical editor answers a drag by rewriting
// the source and re-running the compiler *in the browser*, so exactly one
// text has to compile a diagram in Node and in the page. Two copies of a
// 2,000-line compiler is not a duplication anyone can maintain.
//
// It also **removes** a duplication rather than adding one. `lint.js` is
// zero-dep and standalone by design, and this module has zero dependencies
// of its own, so the linter imports the vocabulary tables instead of
// mirroring them by hand – thirteen tables that used to have to change in
// two files in one commit.
//
// **Pure JavaScript. No imports, no Node APIs, no DOM.** The four leaves
// that were Node-only are injected by the caller (see
// createDiagramCompiler); everything else in here is arithmetic and string
// building. If you find yourself reaching for `fs` or `document`, the thing
// you are writing belongs on the other side of that boundary.
//
// Navigate by the `// ── section ──` banners, the same convention build.js
// uses. The design rationale for the compiler itself is in PRD.md §4.6a and
// CLAUDE.md § Animated infographics; what is here is the code.


// ── diagrams (::: draw) ──────────────────────────────────────────
// A boxes-and-arrows compiler. The source is a line-oriented DSL in the
// lecture markdown; the output is one inline <svg> plus, when the author
// wrote steps, a payload of precomputed per-step geometries that the live
// runtime tweens between.
//
// Three decisions carry the design:
//
// 1. **No constraint solver.** Positions are expressions over a tiny
//    algebra – a grid cell, an anchor on another element, an offset – so
//    the dependency structure is a DAG and resolves by one topological
//    walk. A solver (Constrain, Cassowary) buys generality we do not need
//    and pays for it with non-local failure: an over-constrained system
//    renders plausibly-wrong and reports a residual rather than a line
//    number. Here a mistake names its line.
//
// 2. **Layout runs once per step, at build time.** An animation is not a
//    separate mechanism bolted onto a static picture; a step is just
//    another evaluation of the same layout with different inputs. That is
//    what makes an arrow follow a box that moved – the arrow never stored
//    coordinates, it stored "the right edge of mix".
//
// 3. **The runtime interpolates numbers, nothing else.** No layout, no
//    solver, no geometry in the browser. Every drawable reduces to one of
//    four kinds (rect, circle, path, text) carrying a vector of numbers,
//    and a step transition is a lerp between two vectors. That is why
//    arrowheads are emitted as filled paths rather than SVG markers: a
//    computed head rotates correctly when its endpoints move, and it
//    sidesteps the marker/context-stroke colour question entirely.
//
// The static attributes in the emitted SVG hold the *print* state, so a
// view with no JavaScript – print.html, print-notes.html, view-source –
// shows the finished diagram rather than its opening step.

// SVG's `class` attribute, reached no rule that could paint, and was reported
// nowhere. The corpus proves it was a real trap rather than a theoretical one –
// the author of this compiler wrote such a class **eleven times** in
// `lectures/network-security`, all of them `text … {.bare}`, which cannot act
// because `.bare` names shape children and a free text's ground is un-stroked
// unconditionally.
//
// Two same-shaped cases used to land on opposite sides for no stated reason:
// `box a "A" {.fit}` with no width was an error and `edge p -> q {.smooth}`
// with no `via` was silent. They are in sibling slots. The rule above settles
// both: `.fit` with nothing to fit into stays an error, `.smooth` with no `via`
// stays legal because a later `via` makes it act, and `.smooth` on a *box* –
// which no `via` can ever rescue – becomes the error its sibling already was.
//
// Almost every entry is a fact about the **grammar**, decidable from the kind
// word with no reference to DIAGRAM_CSS, because the kind decides which
// drawables the group holds: an `image` group holds one `<image>` and nothing
// else, a `brace` holds one stroke path, a free `text` holds a label and a rect
// only when it is filled. The handful that are genuinely stylesheet facts –
// `.bare` on a free text, a brace or an edge – are a *stated rule of the
// language* rather than a look, and freezing them here writes down a decision
// already made instead of promising an effect the CSS cannot deliver.

// A positive `.class` and a negative `!class` are legal on exactly the same
// kinds: negation is not an escape hatch for a class a kind can never carry.

// question: **which characters do I replace to change this?**

// 'gap')` says where 0.55 is written, and the edit is a splice. Nothing else
// in the source moves, so the relation the author wrote – `right of reg` –
// survives a gesture that in a coordinate-based tool would have replaced it
// with two numbers.
//
// The result is uniform whether or not the attribute is there yet:
//
//   { start, end, prefix, suffix, present, text }
//
// and applying it is always the same splice:
//

// [start, end) is the token. For one that is absent, start === end is where
// it should go and `prefix` carries the keyword. One shape, no branch at the

  //
  //   - a leader's label printed across the box it pointed past, because
  //     `right of vu gap 2.6` landed inside the element to vu's right;
  //   - two swim-lane boxes placed with absolute `at`, whose half-widths
  //     summed to 1.425 units against 1.35 between their centres, so the
  //     arrow between them had nowhere to be drawn and vanished;
  //   - a tree whose sibling sat close enough under another box to read as
  //     its child.
  //
  // Only plain elements: `box`, `dot`, `text`, `image`. Two groups are out,
  // and `synth` marks both – the same discriminator createSpanTable uses.
  //
  // The parts of a compound statement (a `table`'s cells, a `bars` chart's
  // columns, a `lanes` band's rows) carry `synth` set to their statement's
  // id, and they are adjacent by construction.
  //
  // The statement's own frame carries `synth` set to its *own* id, and it is
  // excluded too – which is not obvious and is what the first version of this
  // check got wrong. A frame is a container: `lanes swim` is drawn around the
  // boxes placed into its bands, a `plot` around the dots and labels placed
  // at its coordinates, a `bars` frame around the text that annotates it.
  // Every false positive the first version produced across the engine's own
  // lectures was a frame enclosing its own contents – swim against the four
  // boxes in its lanes, pace against the dot and two notes plotted on it.
  // `container` and `brace` never reach here at all, for the same reason one
  // level up: enclosing their members is what they are for.
  //
  // Reported only where a pair overlaps at *every* beat at which both are
  // visible. That is what keeps `move` out of it – a box sliding across
  // another on its way somewhere is mid-animation, not a mistake – and it is
  // what lets a label appear where a hidden box still sits without being
  // called a collision. A pair never visible together is never compared.
  // Two tolerances, because two kinds of element measure differently. A box
  // has a drawn border, so its extent is exactly what the room sees and any
  // intersection at all is visible ink. A `text` element's box is the line
  // box: it carries the font's leading above and below the glyphs and draws
  // no outline, so boxes can overlap by most of a line's leading with clear
  // air between the words. Held to one tolerance, the check called two
  // correctly-spaced captions in the engine's own lectures a collision -
  // `bob`/`goals` at 63x16 and `intro`/`lreq` at 5x19, both of which render

  // The tutorial shipped one. On a 126x38 grid, three boxes at `gap 1.05`
  // leave 40 px of clear paper between them and the word `encrypted`
  // measures 71, so the room read `crypte`. Nothing said anything: the
  // compiler knew both numbers and compared them nowhere. Drawing order is
  // what makes it a defect rather than a near miss – a node is painted after
  // every edge that is not `.front`, so the box wins the overlap every time.
  //
  // Three things decide what "the room it has" honestly means, and each one
  // is a case a plain width test would call wrong:
  //
  // - **Both axes, or neither.** A label is clipped only where it overlaps a
  //   shape in *two* dimensions. `side top` lifts the words off the line, and
  //   where the elements at either end are short enough, or the label tall
  //   enough to clear them, the width no longer constrains anything. Testing
  //   the width alone reports those as defects.
  // - **The ink, not the line box.** A measured label carries the font's
  //   leading above and below its glyphs, which is a quarter of the type size
  //   of clear air that reads as overlap. Held to the line box, a label
  //   sitting correctly just above a box is a collision. `DG_LINE_H - 1` is
  //   exactly that air, and it comes off before anything is compared.
  // - **The ends of this edge and nothing else.** A third shape the label
  //   crosses is `dgOverlapWarnings`' business and has a different fix; here
  //   the fix is a number, the `gap` between the two elements named, so the
  //   check only looks at the two elements the edge was drawn between. It is
  //   also what keeps every `sequence` out of it: a message's endpoints are
  //   coordinates on two lifelines rather than element references, so a label
  //   crossing a third actor's lifeline – which is what a lifeline is for,
  //   and why a message's ground is a default – is never compared.
  //
