# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

psi-slides is a **lecture medium**: one Markdown `source.md` per lecture produces four static HTML views – `print.html` (document), `print-notes.html` (document + speaker notes), `audience.html` (live projection), `speaker.html` (cockpit). All four are self-contained, `file://`-openable, no runtime server required.

Status: released, 1.0.0, one maintainer, no test suite. **From 1.0.0 the source format is the interface** – a change that stops an existing `source.md` from building the same way is a major version. The internals carry no such promise. The `lectures/` folder holds the canonical examples of what the tool supports; the design rationale is in `PRD.md`. A separate content repo `../psi-slides-mylectures/` consumes this engine via `node ../psi-slides/build.js` and holds the lectures actively being authored.

## Commands

```bash
# install deps (required once, also before running lectures from sibling content repos)
npm install

# build all four views next to source.md
node build.js lectures/tutorial/source.md

# live-reload authoring (WebSocket reload to open tabs on every save)
node build.js lectures/tutorial/source.md --watch

# for a program that drives the build rather than reads it (the desktop
# builder is the first): one JSON object per line on stdout – build-start,
# build-success (carrying `stats`, the six figures lectureStats counts, and
# `sourceModifiedMs`), build-error, watching, serving, changed (carrying
# `modifiedMs`), patch, asset,
# watch-error – and commands on stdin, {"type":"rebuild"} and
# {"type":"auto","enabled":false}. The human log is untouched beside it; a
# driver tells the two apart by the leading `{"type":`. Without the flag,
# stdin is not read at all.
node build.js <source.md> --watch --events

# partial builds (useful for iterating on one renderer)
node build.js <source.md> --audience-only
node build.js <source.md> --print-only
node build.js <source.md> --print-notes-only   # print + speaker notes
node build.js <source.md> --speaker-only

# image inlining – default is auto: build inlines image assets as data: URIs
# iff the referenced images sum to < 10 MB; logs the decision either way.
# Override the default with these flags (per-image cap is always 2 MB):
node build.js <source.md> --inline-images       # force inline regardless of total size
node build.js <source.md> --no-inline-images    # force external asset paths

# a PNG or JPEG that IS inlined is transcoded to WebP q92 on the way in, and
# this is on by default. It touches nothing on disk: the asset stays a PNG and
# source.md is not rewritten, which is the whole difference from
# --optimize-images below. No cwebp/magick on PATH is not an error - the
# original bytes go in and the build says so once. Nor is a PNG that comes out
# larger as WebP, which small flat images do: the original is kept.
node build.js <source.md> --no-optimize-images  # inline the original bytes

# shrink assets that blow the per-image cap: converts referenced PNG/JPEG to
# WebP q92 in place, replacing the originals and rewriting explicit-path refs
# in source.md – the markdown `](path)` form and the bare token a ::: draw
# `image` statement carries, fenced code skipped (shorthand `![](fig-id)`
# refs need no edit). Needs cwebp or magick on PATH; measured 12-18% of the
# original on real lecture assets.
node build.js <source.md> --optimize-images --dry-run   # report, write nothing
node build.js <source.md> --optimize-images              # apply (assets >= 512 KB)
node build.js <source.md> --optimize-images --all        # every referenced raster
node build.js <source.md> --optimize-images --max-width 2600   # also downscale

# diagrams need no flag either: a ::: draw block compiles to inline SVG
# at build time, and its `step` blocks become beats on the reveal counter.
# The opener is `::: draw [WxH] [autoplay N [cycle]]` - the grid positional,
# playback as keywords, no braces (braces hold sigil tokens only, everywhere).
# See the `psi-slides-figures` skill and lectures/diagrams/source.md.
# The graphical editor for those blocks ships into the live views whenever
# the lecture has one; `editor: none` in the frontmatter declines it, and
# `editor: speaker` keeps it out of the projection. Click a diagram, then the
# button in the corner of the focus card. Spec and build log: editor.md.

# math needs no flag: $inline$ and $$display$$ render via KaTeX during the
# build. The KaTeX stylesheet plus the font families the formulas use are
# inlined only into views that contain math; the build logs the payload.

# scaffold a new lecture folder with valid frontmatter + example chunks
# (in lectures/ by default; --into puts it anywhere else)
node build.js --new my-slug
node build.js --new my-slug --into ~/Documents/talks

# integrate exported live annotations back into source.md – paste the
# speaker's Shift-E snippet (marker-wrapped) at the end of source.md, then:
node build.js <source.md> --integrate-annotations
# moves each `> annot:` block under the matching chunk, removes the marker;
# unresolved ids are parked in a trimmed marker block at EOF.

# serve the built lecture over http on loopback. Everything works from
# file:// except third-party embeds: a file:// page has the origin `null`
# and YouTube's player refuses it (Error 153). Serve, and it plays.
node build.js <source.md> --serve                 # build once, then serve
node build.js <source.md> --serve --port 8080     # fixed port (default: free one)
node build.js <source.md> --watch --serve         # live reload over http

# two questions only a rendered page can answer, so both drive the built
# audience.html in a real browser with playwright-core and both degrade
# rather than fail (no browser, or no playwright-core, says so and leaves the
# exit code alone). They share one bootstrap, `openAudienceProbe`, which reads
# $PSI_CHROME first and then the chrome/msedge channels.
#
# --check-fit asks whether the slide is inside the frame: it walks state by
# state at 1600x900 and reports any slide that fits the frame and is
# positioned outside it. Exit 2 if one is; the density budgets are word
# counts, so cards and rows overflow with a clean lint.
node build.js <source.md> --check-fit
node build.js <source.md> --check-fit --viewport 1920x1080
#
# --squint writes the projection back out as text - what each slide paints,
# what the collapse withholds, what arrives on which beat - to squint.txt
# beside the source. Read it before arguing about a lecture's wording: the
# collapse is CSS and JS, so source.md is not the slide. It never fails a
# build, and it is blind to colour, contrast and overlap - that half is
# --check-fit and your eyes. Notation and the six decisions behind the format:
# the `psi-slides-authoring` skill.
node build.js <source.md> --squint
node build.js <source.md> --squint --squint-out -    # to stdout instead

# static checks – run before committing
node lint.js lectures/                         # all lectures
node lint.js lectures/tutorial/source.md       # single file
node lint.js lectures/ --strict                # warnings → exit 2

# two test suites, split by one question: can this be decided without a
# browser? test/gates/ is everything about the figure language and the {…}
# tail grammar that can - eleven gates, under a second, no browser and no
# `npm install` (diagram-core.mjs, tails.mjs and lint.js are all zero-dep).
# It is also where a hand-mirrored list one file keeps of another's belongs,
# figures or not: `frontmatter` holds lint.js's KNOWN_FRONTMATTER_KEYS
# against what build.js reads.
# test/ is the things that only break in a built page - 34 specs, ~8 min,
# one Chromium. `npm test` also runs test/reproducible.mjs, which needs
# neither: it builds a lecture under a partial flag and under a full one and
# asserts the shared view is the same bytes, because release.yml's
# tracked-output check is only meaningful if a rebuild is a function of the
# source alone.
# `npm test` runs the gates first so a compiler regression fails in a second
# rather than in four minutes; gates.yml runs them on push and PR.
#
# Run the browser suite after touching AUDIENCE_JS, the key map, editor.mjs,
# createSpanTable, or anything that moves a label or an extent. Anything
# checkable without a browser belongs in lint.js or in test/gates/, never here.
#
# WHAT EACH GATE AND EACH SPEC FAMILY GUARDS, and the seven specs that build a
# deck of their own rather than hunting shapes in a real one: test/README.md.
npm run gate                                   # all gates

node test/run.mjs nav                          # specs whose name matches

# project site (GitHub Pages). Assembling it also runs its two gates: every
# link on every page it writes resolves (fragments included), and index.de.html
# still matches index.html in headings, pictures, commands and link targets.
# Neither is a separate step - pages.yml gets them by building the site.
node docs/site/build-site.js _site              # assemble the site into _site/
node docs/site/build-site.js _site --words      # …and print each page's prose
                                                # word count, by <h2> section
PSI_SITE_NAV_ALL=1 node docs/site/build-site.js _site   # bar carries the rows
                                                # of SITE_PAGES that are still
                                                # `pending` - for re-measuring
                                                # the bar's breakpoints
node docs/site/shoot.mjs                        # re-shoot the site's screenshots
node docs/site/shoot.mjs cockpit search         # …or just some of them
```

`shoot.mjs` drives `lectures/python-intro` (build it first) with `playwright-core`
and writes `docs/site/img/*.webp`; the shots that come from another lecture here
say in the shot table why they have to. Every shot of the landing set is the
same chunk in a different
view, so they have to be taken the same way each time – a hand-taken set drifted
in framing and shipped one figure at 860 px while the rest were 1440. It needs a
Chromium (`$PSI_CHROME`, else the Playwright cache, else system Chrome) and
`cwebp` or `magick` to encode. See the header comment for why the CLI
screenshotter cannot do this job.

**Ten shots name a chunk by id, and `node docs/site/shoot.mjs --check-ids`
answers whether those ids still exist** – no browser, no build, a second. It
also runs before every shoot, so a renamed chunk fails there rather than as
`never reached #foo` after a Chromium launch. **Whether a shot is *stale* is
not checked and cannot be**, because a shot is the lecture plus the inlined
stylesheets plus the rig plus the Chromium that drew it; the trigger to
re-shoot, the threshold for bothering, and the reason `refresh-figures --check`
drifts whenever `img/editor.webp` moves are written out beside the shot table.

A source file can silence specific lint warnings with an HTML comment anywhere in the body:

```
<!-- linter: ignore reveal-overuse, density -->
```

## Architecture

### Single-file build pipeline

`build.js` holds the entire rendering stack: parser, three renderers, inlined audience/speaker runtime JS, inlined audience/speaker/print CSS, Shiki highlighter, image-shorthand resolver, WebSocket watch server, and the CLI. It is deliberately one file, and a large one – roughly two thirds of it is the embedded CSS and runtime JS, so the Node-side build logic is much smaller than the file size suggests.

**`diagram-core.mjs` is the one documented exception** (with `tails.mjs`, the tail grammar shared with `lint.js`, as a much smaller second – see *lint.js is independent* below), and the reason is narrow: the graphical editor answers a drag by rewriting the source and re-running the compiler *in the browser*, so exactly one text has to compile a diagram in Node and in the page. Two copies of a 6,500-line compiler is not a duplication anyone can maintain. The file is pure JS with **zero imports and zero Node APIs**; the four leaves that were Node-only (asset resolution, aspect reading, the warning sink, `escapeHtml`) plus a fifth (`assetMarkup`, which splices a vector file inline) are injected by `createDiagramCompiler({…})`. build.js keeps those leaves, the diagram CSS and the step runtime. The move also *removes* a duplication: `lint.js` imports the vocabulary tables instead of mirroring them by hand – tables only, never a function, or the whole compiler comes in behind it and the linter stops being runnable without the Markdown/Shiki stack. See `editor.md` §8.1.

Navigate build.js by the `// ── section ──` banners – `grep -n '^// ── ' build.js`
lists all forty in order, which is the map that cannot go stale. Two of them carry
a decision the name does not:

- `// ── math (KaTeX, rendered at build time) ──` – the family→class map is **parsed out of `katex.min.css`** (`node_modules/katex/dist/`, reached with `nodeRequire.resolve`), never hard-coded, so it survives a KaTeX upgrade; and the stylesheet is emitted only for views that actually contain a formula, because the inlined woff2 faces are 254 KB for the full set. The live views additionally carry `KATEX_TOGGLE_FAMS` (sans + typewriter, ~46 KB) so the maths can follow the `F` toggle; print passes no `fontToggle` flag and pays nothing extra.
- `// ── audience rendering ──` – `renderHelpOverlay(view)` generates the `?` cheat sheet for **both** live views from one data structure – edit labels there, not in the per-view HTML.

### Parser

`parseLecture(src)` is **line-based, not AST-based**. It walks the source tracking fence state, a `layoutStack` of open `:::` directives, a `currentExpansion` slot, and `pendingNotes`, emitting a `{frontmatter, columns: [{chunks: [...]}]}` structure. `marked` is only invoked later on each chunk's *body string* – by the time `marked` runs, reveal segments have already been split on standalone `---` lines (fence-aware). Attribute-tail syntax `{.width #id}` and the `type: Heading | Sub {...}` prefix are parsed by hand, not by `marked`.

Design implications:

- A line that is exactly `---` inside a chunk body but **outside a code fence** is a reveal-segment separator, not a thematic break. `***` is available if an author needs a true horizontal rule. **At the top level it splits the body into `.reveal-segment` divs; below it – inside a `::: side` pane, a captured `::: cards` / `::: rows` body, an `::: overlay` card or a divider's body – it becomes `BEAT_MARK`, an empty `.beat-mark` div, because a wrapper cannot straddle two segments.** `chunkBeats` in `AUDIENCE_JS` reads segments, diagram steps and markers in one document-order walk, so nested beats interleave with top-level ones in source order; a marker inside an `.overlay-card[data-from]` carries `at` and counts from the card's own `from`. The elements a marker governs get `data-beat-hidden`, which is `visibility: hidden` at three classes of specificity – **not** `display: none`: a nested beat keeps its box so the pane, the row or the card row stands at its final height from beat 0 and the slide does not jump per press, while a top-level segment still closes up. Print hides only the marker. `::: expand` keeps the `<hr>` – its body is off the projection.
- `::: expand <label>` and `::: footnote` / `::: marginalia` become separate nodes attached to the chunk (`::: margin` is the older spelling of `::: footnote`, still accepted and documented nowhere); `::: cols N`, `::: side` / `::: flip`, `::: slide` / `::: script` are layout wrappers that stay inline in the body as `<div>`/`<aside>` elements and let `marked`'s html-block passthrough render the inner Markdown.
- `::: slide` / `::: script` are the **explicit slide-content** escape hatch from topic-sentence extraction (PRD §4.5). They add no runtime state and no sync field: the parser emits `.slide-explicit` / `.script-only` wrappers and the whole mode is CSS (`:has()` rules under `[data-collapse=topic-bold]`), plus a `closest()` guard in `splitSentencesIn` so explicit blocks are never abridged. The hiding selector must match at any depth (`*:not(.slide-explicit):not(:has(.slide-explicit)):not(.slide-explicit *)`) – matching only `.reveal-segment > *` breaks as soon as a `::: slide` sits inside a `::: side` or `::: cols` wrapper.
- `::: cols N` **folds to a single column while collapsed** (`[data-collapse=topic-bold] .cols-2, .cols-3 { column-count: 1 }`). Collapsed content is one topic sentence per paragraph, and `.cols > *` sets `break-inside: avoid`, so the browser can only balance in whole paragraphs – a one-line and a five-line paragraph land as a stub beside a wall of text, and two short ones as two stubs with the full gutter between them. Print and the un-collapsed reading mode keep the author's columns, where there is enough content to balance.
- Speaker notes are blockquotes whose first line matches `note:` exactly; they attach to the current chunk (or to the next one if they precede the first chunk).

### lint.js is independent

`lint.js` is a **zero-dep** linter – nothing from `node_modules`, so it runs as a pre-commit gate without the Markdown/Shiki stack. It deliberately does not import anything from `build.js`; it re-implements the parsing contract and mirrors the constants (`VALID_TAGS`, `DENSITY_BUDGET`, `VIEW_DEFAULTS`). When you change the parser vocabulary in `build.js`, update `lint.js` in the same commit – the duplication is the price paid for keeping the linter runnable without the Markdown/Shiki stack.

**Two exceptions to that no-imports rule, and both are the same kind of file.** The **diagram vocabulary** is imported from `diagram-core.mjs`, which has no dependencies of its own, so importing it costs nothing this file was protecting and removes every table that used to have to change in two places in one commit. **Tables only.** A function from that module would pull the whole compiler in behind it – with the one bend recorded in the `psi-slides-figures` skill, for rules that ARE the vocabulary. The **`{…}` tail grammar and the `::: draw` opener** are imported from `tails.mjs`: zero dependencies, under 400 lines, the slot tables (`CHUNK_SLOTS`, `CARDS_SLOTS`, `OVERLAY_SLOTS`, `BACKDROP_SLOTS`, `SIDE_SLOTS`) plus `splitTail`, `parseTail`, `parseDrawOpener` and `formatDrawOpener`, and nothing behind them – so the concern the tables-only rule guards against does not arise, and both files read every tail through one parser. Before it existed the grammar was implemented four times and lint.js reported the same refusal under six codes. `parseTail` never throws; it returns `problems: [{code, msg}]` under four codes – `stray-attribute`, `unknown-class`, `same-slot`, `multiple-ids` – and build.js throws the first as a `userFacing` error while lint.js reports each. **The four `::: draw` refusals live in the `psi-slides-figures` skill**, with the reasoning each one encodes.

Checks enforced:

- Unknown type, unknown class (`unknown-class`, one code for a word from no slot of any `{…}` tail, the directive named in the message).
- Duplicate or missing chunk IDs (required on every non-title chunk).
- Unclosed `:::` directives and orphan `:::` closers.
- Per-type word-count budgets (principle/question 80, definition 200, example 250, free 250, exercise 350; title/figure unlimited). Counted against the **on-screen** half only: the `::: slide` block if the chunk has one, otherwise everything outside `::: script`.
- Duplicate `::: slide` / `::: script` blocks in one chunk (warning).
- **What may open inside what.** Ten refusals the build mirrors line for line
  (`aside-in-layout`, `overlay-in-layout`,
  `directive-in-overlay`, `directive-in-cards`, `directive-in-embed`,
  `side-in-cols`, `duplicate-flip`, `explicit-nested`, a directive other than
  `backdrop` / `draw` / `cards` / `rows` / `overlay` under a column heading,
  plus the older `cards-nested` / `draw-in-cols` / `nested-directive`) and six
  warnings only the linter raises (`side-without-flip`, `cols-in-cols`,
  `explicit-in-side`, `duplicate-marginalia`, `layout-too-narrow`,
  `overlay-from-beyond`), plus `text-on-picture` for words standing on a
  `::: backdrop {.clear}` – measured on a photograph of a chain, where a grey
  agenda was unreadable from the room; the fixes are the other two scrims or
  a panel / dock. A `---` inside a wrapper is not one of them: it is
  a beat below the top level (see *Parser* above), and `test/beats-nested.mjs`
  walks the order in a browser. `::: draw` deliberately goes nearly everywhere – a
  pane, a card, an overlay, an expansion, a divider – and is refused only in a
  text flow (`cols`) and a caption (`embed`). The
  table is in the `psi-slides-authoring` skill under *Nesting*; the pairs are
  fixtures in `test/settings.mjs`. Every refusal was a slide that rendered
  wrong with exit 0 – a `::: expand` inside `::: cols` handed its closer to
  the columns, a `::: cols` inside `::: overlay` drew an empty column block
  – and the corpus nests exactly one thing, a figure in a pane, so none of
  them costs an existing lecture a build.
- Unknown value for a viewer-default frontmatter key (`unknown-view-default`, error), for a `style:` key (`unknown-style-setting`, error) or for an `identity:` key (`unknown-identity-setting` and `bad-identity-colour`, errors; `accent-contrast`, a warning that mirrors no refusal – it is the one case the build cannot fix, a bold phrase in prose set in an accent with no ground to reverse against). Both mirror a build refusal that now runs in the `buildOnce` pre-flight, so `--print-only` refuses a typo in `auto-fit` and `--audience-only` refuses one in `print-slide-numbers`.
- Assets over the 2 MB inline cap (`oversized-asset`, warning) – the pre-commit gate for the single-file property.
- Unclosed display math (`unclosed-math`, warning). Fence-aware. Inline `$…$` is deliberately not checked: a lone dollar in prose is legitimate and the build leaves it alone.
- A bold of two words or fewer sitting after a paragraph's first sentence
  (`single-word-bold`, warning; the author-facing rule is in the
  `psi-slides-authoring` skill). **It mirrors `splitSentencesIn`'s head/rest walk
  and its three sentence helpers, which live inside the `AUDIENCE_JS` template
  literal and so cannot be imported** – keep them congruent or the two files
  disagree about where a first sentence ends. **The mirror is guarded in
  `test/settings.mjs`**, which lifts the helpers out of a built `audience.html`
  and out of `lint.js` *as text* and runs them side by side, because neither copy
  can be imported: lint.js calls `main()` at module scope, and the build's copy
  is characters inside a string until a page runs it. That is the assertion that
  matters – a contract drifts when someone changes a number, visibly; an
  algorithm drifts when someone fixes an edge case in the renderer, invisibly,
  and the warning then describes a collapse that no longer happens.
- Reveal-overuse (>50% of chunks using segments in a lecture flags a warning).
- Orphan columns (columns with <2 chunks).
- Figure caption redundancy (`figure:` chunk opens with an image whose alt text becomes a `<figcaption>` stacked under the heading – discourages three-label pile-ups of heading + sub-heading + caption).

**`build.js` and `lint.js` are a deliberate duplication, and keeping them congruent is the work.** A code review over the decoration family found eight defects, seven of which were places the two disagreed – four in the direction that matters, where the build *accepted* what the linter refuses. That direction merges green, because CI lints `lectures/network-security` and `lectures/diagrams` but never builds them. **When you add a refusal to one file, grep the other for the same key in the same commit.** And when a rule already exists – a pre-flight, a fallback refusal for an unreadable directive – the question is not whether to write it but which other constructs are still missing from it.

### Four outputs, three renderers, one source

The four HTML files are **self-contained outputs**. They ship with their runtime JS/CSS inlined from build.js template literals, so they open from `file://` without a server. They are gitignored (`lectures/*/print.html`, `lectures/*/print-notes.html`, `lectures/*/audience.html`, `lectures/*/speaker.html`) – rebuild instead of committing them. Three lectures are the exception: `lectures/tutorial/`, so readers can browse the self-referential tour straight from the repo; `lectures/diagrams/`, the only place every `::: draw` construct is drawn rather than described; and `lectures/decoration/`, the only place the cover, divider, card, backdrop and overlay constructions are shown rather than described. Rebuild and commit all four views whenever one of the three sources changes – the release workflow fails if they are stale.

`print-notes.html` is a second pass through the print renderer with `withNotes: true`; it embeds each chunk's `> note:` text as a `.speaker-note` aside under the chunk so a printed hand-out can show “what was on the slide + what the lecturer said”. Layout, CSS, and asset inlining are otherwise identical to `print.html`.

The audience↔speaker sync is cross-`file://`-origin safe because it uses `window.postMessage` over the opener relationship. Chrome's per-file opaque-origin policy isolates `BroadcastChannel` between tabs loaded from disk, which is why postMessage is the load-bearing channel. See `speaker.md` §2 for the full state-ownership matrix (audience is state root; speaker holds a local shadow plus a `frozen` flag). Four message families deliberately bypass the freeze gate because they are commands to the projector rather than shared state: `blank` (so `B` still works while frozen), `slide-ref` (the audience's window dimensions after a resize), `link-show` / `link-hide` (the address overlay) and `demo` with its three `demo-*` handshake messages (the live demo, `D`: the cockpit captures a window or screen with `getDisplayMedia` and the projection shows it – directly as the cockpit's `MediaStream` when both windows are one origin under `--serve`, through an `RTCPeerConnection` on loopback from `file://`; the `psi-slides-media` skill has the whole of it). Resist the urge to fold either back into the state snapshot – `applyRemoteState` is a *full* apply, so a snapshot sent for one field drags the receiver's slide position with it.

### Asset inlining

Image assets are inlined into the single-file outputs by default (auto-inline budget: 10 MB total, per-file cap 2 MB; `--inline-images` / `--no-inline-images` overrides).

An asset over the per-file cap **fails the build**. It used to be a warning, and the output then shipped with an external path: correct on the machine that built it, broken figure anywhere the HTML travelled alone. `assertInlinable()` runs as a pre-flight in `buildOnce` before any rendering, so a failed build leaves no half-written artefact, and its message branches on what the author can actually do – convert (raster), install an encoder first (no cwebp/magick), or simplify by hand (oversized SVG, which `--optimize-images` cannot help with). The escape hatch is `--no-inline-images`, which is an explicit choice to ship external paths. `lint.js` keeps a matching `oversized-asset` warning (pure `fs.statSync`, still zero-dep) so the problem surfaces before the build too.

Errors of this kind set `err.userFacing = true`; the top-level handler prints the message without a stack trace, because a stack only buries the instructions. Reserve the flag for things the author must act on, never for defects in the build. Note what that verb deliberately does **not** do: it does not downscale by default. The offenders measured in the content repo were not oversized in pixels (the worst was 3.03 MB at exactly 1920×1080) and figure focus zooms to `FIG_MAX_SCALE` (8×), so a 3968px-wide diagram is high-resolution on purpose. WebP q92 alone gets those files to 12–18% of their original size. `--max-width` exists for real outliers and only ever shrinks – `cwebp -resize` would happily enlarge a narrower image, so `imageSize()` (a zero-dep PNG/JPEG header reader) gates it. Raster formats become base64 `data:` URIs in `<img>` tags. **SVG assets are spliced inline as `<svg>` elements** (not `data:` URIs) so they inherit page CSS custom properties – `--ink`, `--paper`, `--ink-soft` – and re-color when the user cycles themes with the `A` hotkey. To keep multiple inlined SVGs from cross-contaminating each other, the inliner gives every instance a unique `psi-fig-N-` prefix and rewrites `id="…"`, `url(#…)`, `href="#…"`, and `xlink:href="#…"` accordingly; inline `<style>` blocks are wrapped in `@scope (svg#psi-fig-N-root) { … }` (with `@import` and `@font-face` hoisted out so they remain at top level). See `inlineSvg()` in `build.js`.

### Authoring contract

By default every chunk must open with a **topic sentence that stands on its own**, because in the live audience view the `topic-bold` collapse mode renders only that sentence plus any `**bold**` fragments. Authors promote bullet-worthy phrases to bold; unbolded continuation prose renders only in print. How such a bold looks is `style: {bold: …}` / `style: {print-bold: …}` (`BOLD_LOOKS`, `DERIVED_STRONG`), and `*em*` inside one is the stress mark. This shapes both the render logic (the `splitSentencesIn` walker and collapse CSS) and the lint budgets (narrow types have small budgets because the topic sentence is the payload).

A chunk can opt out of that derivation with `::: slide` (this block is the screen) or `::: script` (everything but this block is the screen). Use it when the argument wants continuous prose that no first-sentence rule can carve up sensibly. See PRD §4.5.

### Chunk grammar

Chunk grammar: `## type: Heading | Sub-Heading {.width #id}` where `type` is one of `title`, `closing`, `outline`, `principle`, `definition`, `example`, `question`, `figure`, `exercise`, `free`, and width is one of `narrow` (28em), `standard` (36em), `wide` (52em), `full` (72em). The `|` sub-heading and the `{...}` attribute tail are both optional; width defaults to `standard`.

An attribute tail may also carry six non-width classes: `.bare` and `.center`
(audience-only) and `.wrap-none` / `.wrap-balance` / `.blocks-left` /
`.blocks-center` (`CHUNK_STYLE_CLASSES`, a `style:` key answered for one chunk,
and these four reach print). The whole tail vocabulary is `CHUNK_SLOTS` in
`tails.mjs`, a slot table like the five directives': width is a slot of four,
each style key a slot of two, `.bare` and `.center` flags with no writable
default. All six are refused on a `title` or
`closing` chunk except the `style:` four. **The vocabulary, what each one costs,
the character budget a code line has and why `.bare` hides rather than drops are
in the `psi-slides-authoring` and `psi-slides-appearance` skills** – authoring
for what to write, appearance for what the build does with it.

Two things worth knowing before writing chunks, because neither is guessable and
both were learned the hard way:

- **`principle` is not a narrow type.** The type sets treatment and budget, never width. The docs used to pair it with `.narrow` and every example followed, which made anything longer than one sentence a tall thin ribbon. Prefer `.standard`; `narrow` itself went from 22em to 28em for the same reason.
- **The live views do not print the type name.** The small-caps eyebrow (PRINCIPLE, DEFINITION, …) was removed from `renderAudienceChunk`: it announced a taxonomy only as right as the type choice was, and a mislabelled slide reads to the room as an error. `renderChunk` (the document renderer) still emits `.chunk-label`, and `.tag-label` in the audience is now only the *expansion* label. Search results read the type off `data-tag` for this reason.

### Animated infographics (`::: draw`) and the diagram editor

**Development state, not in any tagged release.** `package.json` still reports
1.0.0 and the latest tag does not include the feature; the changelog entry stays
under `## [Unreleased]`. Publishing `main` and cutting a release are separate
events – `pages.yml` redeploys the project site on every push.

A boxes-and-arrows compiler: a line-oriented DSL inside the lecture markdown
compiles to one inline `<svg>` plus, where the author wrote `step` blocks, a
payload of per-beat geometries the live runtime tweens between. `renderDiagram()`
is the entry point. **`diagram-core.mjs` is the one documented exception to the
single-file build**, because the browser editor has to run the same compiler; it
is pure JS with zero imports and zero Node APIs.

**The whole vocabulary, the slot tables, the generated names, the four design
decisions and the editor's contract are in the `psi-slides-figures` skill.** Read
it before authoring a `::: draw` block or changing `diagram-core.mjs`,
`editor.mjs`, or the diagram half of `lint.js`. `figure-design.md` is the craft
that sits on top of it; `editor.md` §15 is the build log.

**What stays true here:** `lint.js` imports the diagram vocabulary from
`diagram-core.mjs` – tables only, never a function, or the whole compiler comes
in behind it and the linter stops being runnable without the Markdown/Shiki
stack. The opener `::: draw [WxH] [autoplay N [cycle]]` is read by
`parseDrawOpener` in `tails.mjs` for build.js, lint.js and the corpus gate
alike; the compiler is handed the grid alone as its head-attribute string, and the whole
opener rides in the figure's source payload as one formatted line so the
editor can write the block back verbatim. Steps ride the existing reveal
counter, so `revealed[chunkId]` remains the only state sync, the freeze gate
and localStorage recovery share.

### Slide decoration and section dividers

Five constructs are one idea – **a slide is a frame, and the frame can carry more
than a text column**: `cover:` (ten compositions, with `subtitle:`,
`cover-image:`, `cover-ratio:`, `cover-align:`, `cover-ground:`, and the credit
block's four ranks – `presenter:`, `affiliation:`, and `contact:` / `notice:`
as one row along the foot, with `closing-credits:` saying how much of it the
last slide repeats), `::: backdrop`, `::: overlay`,
`::: dock`, and `::: cards` / `::: rows`. Overlay and dock share one vocabulary
and differ in one contract: an overlay lies *over* the slide, a dock is *part of
the frame* and the text column yields to it (a side column reserved as the
chunk's padding, a band as a grid row); `.every` under a `#` heading puts a dock
on every chunk of the part, and a `#id` link in it is a live marker. `## closing:` is the cover's bookend and
`## outline:` the running agenda; `section:` gives a column's divider slide six
compositions, every one of them quieter than the cover. All of it is additive: a
`source.md` using none of it builds byte-identically to before.

**The full vocabulary, the slot tables, the refusals, and the CSS traps each one
cost are in the `psi-slides-decoration` skill.** Read it before changing the
decoration or divider renderers, their `lint.js` mirrors, or `test/settings.mjs`.
`lectures/decoration/source.md` is where the constructs are shown rather than
described.

**What stays true here:** the class tails are closed vocabularies resolved into
slots by `parseTail` in `tails.mjs`, and **no word may appear in two slots of one table** –
`tails.mjs` asserts it at load. A check that can refuse a deck belongs in the
`buildOnce` pre-flight beside `assertInlinable`, not in a renderer, or
`--print-only` never reaches it.

### Type, themes and viewer defaults

Three font families ship in any one output as variable `wght` latin subsets,
upright and italic; **which three is a per-lecture decision** made in the `fonts:`
block, where a bundled name needs no file and an author-supplied one is matched
out of `fonts/` beside `source.md`. `ligatures:` separates prose ligatures (on)
from code ligatures (off – `->` and `--` are two different edges in the figure
grammar). `lang:` picks the hyphenation dictionary and, from the localisation
pass, also selects the words the build *invents* – the TOC heading, the note
labels, the print type eyebrow, the projection's `EXERCISE`, the `<title>`
suffixes – out of the `STRINGS` table (`lectureStrings`, keyed by primary
subtag, `en` fallback with a one-line `[lang]` warning for a locale it has no
wording for); a top-level `labels:` block overrides any one word (free values,
closed key set, `unknown-label-key` refused in the `buildOnce` pre-flight and
mirrored in `lint.js`). `STRINGS.en` is the current literals transcribed
character for character, so a deck with no `lang:` or `lang: en` builds
byte-identical HTML. `style: {hyphenate: …}`
says which views use it (`print` – the default and today's behaviour – / `all` /
`none`); the two are separate keys because the language is a property of the
lecture and the hyphenation is a preference. Seven themes cycle on
`A`, and `applyFontTheme()` sets `body[data-mode]`, which is what every piece of
chrome keys off rather than a theme name. Seven frontmatter keys pin how a
lecture opens; an unknown value **fails the build**, because a typo here is
otherwise invisible, and a top-level key no renderer reads at all is a
`lint.js` warning (`unknown-frontmatter-key`, exit 2 under `--strict`) rather
than a build failure – `author:` was the case that produced it.

Two `style:` keys answer the same question for the two grounds separately.
`neutrals` says what hue the greys carry, because the `A` key moves `--emph`
alone in the four light themes while every tinted surface is mixed out of
`--ink` at hue 260; `print-neutrals` says it for the documents, whose paper is
warm already, and its default is a deferral rather than a value (`''` is
seeded, `printNeutrals()` resolves it, the shape `printSlideNums()` documents).
`headline` and `caps` are the title pair's two treatments – which of the two
lines is loud, and whether the small type round them is set in capitals. The
tracking capitals need is applied by the build to any slot already in capitals
and is deliberately not a key.

**`identity:` is a top-level block, not a `style:` key**, because it answers a
different question: `style:` is taste, `identity:` is whose deck this is.
`identity: {accent: "#EC8A3C"}` re-points `--emph` across the four light
themes, on `dark` and in the document, and with it the two things CSS cannot
derive: `--accent-h`, which is a bare number in an `oklch()` argument list
rather than a colour, and `--emph-ink`, the ink on an accent ground, which is
a *measurement* – `.cards.cg-accent` reverses the paper onto the accent, which
is right for the five tuned accents because they are dark, and wrong for a
house colour out of a print manual, which usually is not (#EC8A3C carries
white at 2.54:1). The arithmetic is `colour.mjs`, the third module `lint.js`
may import; **`diagram-core.mjs` keeps its own copy of the same chain and
must**, because it is spliced into the browser as text and an `import` line
there is a syntax error in every built page while every Node-side gate stays
green. `test/gates/identity.mjs` holds the two together and holds both against
the four accent ratios `build.js` states in prose. Scoping is
`body[data-theme^=light]` plus one rule for `dark`, emitted after the main
stylesheet so source order decides – which makes the accent immune to `A` by
construction, with no reader key disabled and the two terminal themes left
with the single phosphor tone they are.

**`palette:` is its own top-level block** and gives the figure language four
accents that mean something: it re-points the base each `tone-N` is mixed from
and changes no percentage, so `DG_BAR_CONTRAST_MIN` and the box/column
distinction operate unchanged on the new colours. Scoped to the light themes,
with the derived mixes as the fallback on `dark` and the two terminal themes -
four hues tuned against white paper are not four hues on phosphor green, and
the derivation is what makes a theme switch survivable. `DG_BOX_FILLS` lives
in `build.js` rather than in `diagram-core.mjs` because that file is spliced
into every page as text: a table there costs four views their bytes on every
deck for something the browser never reads. It mirrors the hand-written
`── tones ──` rules and `test/gates/palette.mjs` holds the two together. Both
`build.js` and `lint.js` mix **in oklab**, which is what `color-mix(in oklab,
…)` does; interpolating a hue instead lands on a different colour and gives a
plausible number for it.

**A fourth role, `display`, is the exception to all of that**: `fonts: {display:
Anton}` names one of 32 OFL faces for the cover, the closing slide and the
section dividers, and nothing else in the deck wears it. It has no default, so
a deck that names none embeds nothing and builds byte-identically; it is not
held to the variable-subset rule, because a headline carries no bold; and each
face carries a **measured** `size-adjust` (these faces differ in advance width
by a factor of three, and the cover's type size is tuned for Literata). Two
properties are structural rather than enforced, and both break the moment
`display` joins `FONT_CYCLE` or `--display-stack` is assigned under a
`body[data-font=…]` / `body[data-theme=…]` selector: the reader's `F` and `A`
keys cannot reach it.

**The rosters, the slot tables, the measured advance widths, the precedence
rules and the 1.0.0 recipe are in the `psi-slides-appearance` skill.**

**What stays true here:** `FONT_STACK_TAILS`, `THEME_NAMES` / `DARK_THEME_NAMES`,
`VIEW_DEFAULT_SPEC` and `STYLE_SPEC` are each a single source of truth that
`lint.js` mirrors – change them in the same commit. (`CHUNK_STYLE_CLASSES` is
not mirrored any more: it lives in `tails.mjs` and both files import it.) And **`dgCharW` in `diagram-core.mjs` is
calibrated to the bundled sans**: a roster change that does not re-measure it
overflows figure labels silently.

Three of the viewer defaults carry a decision the table does not:

- **`slide-numbers` defaults to `horizontal`.** It defaulted to `vertical` up to
  1.0.0, and this is the one viewer default whose own change moves what an
  existing deck renders – stacked digits put slide 10 on two lines. The old
  rendering is `slide-numbers: vertical`, and there is deliberately no
  compatibility flag beside it.
- **`print-slide-numbers` has no default, it defers.** Absent, it resolves to
  whatever the live key resolved to. `printSlideNums()` is the one documented
  step that does that (`printSlideNums || slideNums || SLIDE_NUM_DEFAULT`);
  reading the key anywhere else with a fallback would silently make an unset
  key mean `horizontal` rather than "follow".
- **`auto-fit` is three modes and `state.autoFitMode` is a string.** Frontmatter
  says `true` / `false` / `shrink`, the runtime says `full` / `off` / `shrink`,
  and `AUTO_FIT_FROM_KEY` is where the two meet. **Never write
  `if (state.autoFitMode)`** – all three words are truthy; `autoFitOn()` is the
  test and `autoFitCeiling()` is the whole difference between the two on-modes
  (2.2 vs the lecturer's own zoom). The snapshot carries the mode *and* a legacy
  boolean, because `--audience-only` rebuilds one of the two windows and an
  older peer coerces the field with `!!`.

### Video, hosted embeds and link addresses

A clip is a figure that moves, so it shares the `![](clip-id)` shorthand rather
than getting a directive of its own; over `MAX_INLINE_VIDEO_BYTES` (12 MB) it is
**staged** to `videos/` beside the output instead of failing the way an oversized
image does. `::: embed <url>` is its own directive precisely because it is the
single construct that makes an output fetch from a third party at run time. An
external link puts its **address plus a build-time QR code** on both screens
instead of opening a page on the projector. The live views also carry the
encoder itself, spliced in as text like `diagram-core.mjs`, for the one address
a build cannot know: the one typed into a live annotation (`N`), which fills
the frame while it is typed and puts a code above the words.

**The extension tables, the sync protocols, the staging rules and the
`file://` Error 153 case are in the `psi-slides-media` skill.**

**What stays true here:** video, embed and diagram-edit state all sync as their
own message types rather than through the state snapshot – `applyRemoteState` is
a *full* apply, so a snapshot sent for one field drags the receiver's slide
position with it. See `speaker.md` §2.

### Desktop app (`desktop/`)

An Electron window around the build for people who will not open a terminal:
open a `source.md`, build on every save, open the four views. **It is its own
package** – `desktop/package.json`, its own lockfile, its own `node_modules/`
– and nothing of it reaches the root: no Electron in the root `package.json`,
no root script that touches `desktop/`, `desktop/ export-ignore` in
`.gitattributes` so the engine tarball stays what the README says it is, and
`desktop.yml` is path-filtered so a lecture commit does not run a
three-platform matrix. Its tests live in `desktop/test/` with their own
runner; `npm test` in the root does not run them.

**The app drives `build.js` through `--events`, never through the human log.**
It spawns the engine as a child (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, argument array, no
shell) with `--watch --events`, reads the JSON lines on stdout as state and
everything else on stdout and stderr as the raw log, and sends `rebuild` and
`auto` commands on stdin. So the event names and fields in the `--events`
section of `build.js` are an interface with one consumer: change one there
and `desktop/main/builder.js` and its `events.test.mjs` change in the same
commit. The human log lines are free to move. The engine the packaged app
runs is a copy staged by `desktop/scripts/stage-engine.mjs` – `build.js`, the
four files it reads relative to itself, the one it imports, plus a production
`npm ci` – so a new runtime file that `build.js` reads via `import.meta.url`
has to be added to that script's `FILES` or the packaged app fails **every**
build: the read is a bare `readFileSync` inside a renderer, so it throws
`ENOENT` before any view reaches disk rather than degrading one view.
`desktop/test/stage-engine.test.mjs` holds the list against `build.js` as
text in both directions, which is what `cue-cards.mjs` cost – it was off the
list from the day it landed through builder 0.1.1.

The design brief the interface is built against is `desktop/DESIGN.md`; the
plan, its decisions and its build log are `PLAN-electron-builder.md`.

## Reference material

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – **the build and release procedure** (§ Building and releasing): what the two workflows do, what has to be true before tagging, and why the release asset names cannot change. Follow it rather than improvising a release.
- `test/README.md` – **the two test suites and which one a thing belongs in**: what each of the eleven gates guards, the four browser-spec families, and the seven specs that build a deck of their own rather than hunting shapes in a real one.
- `PRD.md` – §1 non-negotiables, §2 content model, §2.1 type vocabulary, §3 source format + parsing contract, §4 visual language, §7 speaker view, §9 build system. Read this before making design-shape changes.
- `speaker.md` – speaker spec and the `window.postMessage` sync protocol (fields, direction, freeze gating, timer, localStorage recovery).
- `editor.md` – the diagram editor: what it is for, the four decisions, the grammar contract it edits against, the drag policy, and **§15, a build log written while building** – what landed, what it cost, and what bit. Read §15 first if you are picking the work up. §13 answers the two questions the plan left open, from the running prototype, and §14 is how a picture gets into a figure.
- `.claude/skills/psi-slides-authoring/SKILL.md` – **how to write a lecture `source.md`**: the chunk grammar in practice, the `:::` directive vocabulary, reveal segments, notes, images and math, with worked examples. Invoked as the `psi-slides-authoring` skill.
- `.claude/skills/psi-slides-figures/SKILL.md` – **the `::: draw` vocabulary and the editor's contract**, lifted out of this file so it loads when figures are the work. Every statement, class, slot table and generated name, plus the four decisions behind the compiler. Invoked as the `psi-slides-figures` skill.
- `.claude/skills/psi-slides-decoration/SKILL.md` – **the cover, backdrop, overlay, card, row and divider vocabulary**, same reasoning: the slot tables, the refusals, and the CSS traps each construct cost. Invoked as the `psi-slides-decoration` skill.
- `.claude/skills/psi-slides-appearance/SKILL.md` – **type, themes and viewer defaults**: the bundled and author-supplied font rosters, `ligatures:`, `lang:`, the seven themes, the six viewer-default keys, the whole eighteen-key `style:` block including `labels`, `blocks`, `bold` / `print-bold`, `code`, `neutrals` / `print-neutrals` and `headline` / `caps`, the four chunk classes that answer `wrap` and `blocks` for one slide, and the recipe for the 1.0.0 look. Invoked as the `psi-slides-appearance` skill.
- `.claude/skills/psi-slides-media/SKILL.md` – **video, hosted embeds and link addresses**: the extension tables, the two sync protocols, clip staging, and the build-time QR codes. Invoked as the `psi-slides-media` skill.
- `figure-design.md` – **how to lay out a `::: draw` so a room reads it**, as instructions rather than principles: fifteen rules, most with a wrong/right pair in real syntax, the tone-to-role table, the four-beat step order, and a checklist to work down before a figure is finished. Written for a person and a language model equally. Read it before authoring figures; the grammar itself is in the `psi-slides-figures` skill.
- `HANDOFF.md` – slice-by-slice build diary in German/English mix. Latest sections describe current state and deliberate non-choices. Update when landing a substantial slice.
- `README.md` – short public-facing intro.
- `lectures/tutorial/source.md` – the canonical authoring reference (self-referential lecture). Build and open its `audience.html` to see every directive live.
- `lectures/diagrams/source.md` – every `::: draw` construct, including two of the stepped figures the feature was built for (CBC decryption, a stack frame being overrun) and, in `#sequence` and `#seqmore`, the whole of the `sequence` sub-grammar with two annotations hung off its generated names. Its `#look` chunk is the reference for the class vocabulary: every fill, every family, and the three answers to how type meets its box.

  **Most of the browser suite drives this lecture, and it addresses the figures
  by chunk id, so a drawing here has tests on it.** (Twenty specs at the time of
  writing, seventeen of them naming a chunk.) Keep a chunk's id and its `::: draw`
  block together and they stay green; move a row onto another slide and the spec
  that measured it has to follow. The current map is a command rather than a
  table here, because a table would rot:

  ```bash
  grep -l "lecture = 'diagrams'" test/*.mjs        # the specs
  grep -oE "(walkTo|ed\.open|getElementById)\('[a-z0-9-]+'\)" test/<spec>.mjs
  ```

  `#look` was one six-row catalogue until each row went to the slide that
  explains it – a room cannot hold "the bottom row of the catalogue" – and the
  four specs that measured it were repointed at `#outlines`, `#prominence` and
  `#typefit`. One could not be: `editor-guides` needs three elements collinear
  on a bare `at`, which no lecture figure owes it, so it builds a fixture deck.
  **That is the pattern for any spec needing a shape the lectures do not have**,
  and `test/README.md` says why and lists the five others that do it.

  The lecture-wide `draw-defaults` block is in its frontmatter.
- `lectures/decoration/source.md` – **every slide-decoration construct, shown rather than described**: the card and row vocabulary, `::: side` with a ratio, `::: backdrop` with a `reveal` in both directions, `::: overlay` with `from`, `{.bare}`, `::: draw … autoplay N cycle`, a `## outline:` chunk, a `## closing:` slide, the three kinds of divider content – a quotation, a photograph and a figure, one per column – and, since the frame work, the three panel compositions (`::: overlay {.panel}` as a column, a band and the whole frame), a part with an inherited `::: dock` beside prose, columns, a band at the head and a `from 2` column, the slot cards for overlay and dock, and the beats below the top level (six beats through two panes and a card row; rows arriving one at a time). `lectures/frame-lab/` is the untracked edge-case deck those were chosen from. It is the third tracked lecture, for the same reason `lectures/diagrams/` is the second: a reader should be able to see a construct working before writing it.

  **A deck has exactly one cover and one `section:` variant, so one lecture cannot show ten and six.** This one wears `cover: quote` and `section: outline` and names the rest in a card row; the gallery of all ten compositions lives on the project site, where ten compositions side by side is what the page is for.

- `lectures/network-security/source.md` – **thirty-six real lecture slides rebuilt as figures**, and the reason the outlines, `.turn`, `bars`, `grid`, `plot` and `.smooth` exist. Rebuilt from two PowerPoint decks with the wording kept verbatim (original typos included, each marked in a `#` comment) and the arrangement redrawn. Read it for what the vocabulary looks like at scale; `figure-design.md` is the rules it was built against. Linted **and built** by CI, as a compiler check on the largest body of real figures there is, but not published – unlike `lectures/diagrams/`, which is now both. Its views are not tracked, so a build here is the only thing that compiles it.
- `lectures/python-intro/source.md` – richest example of `::: cols`, `::: side`, and `::: marginalia` in combination, 36 chunks. It is also what the project site's screenshots come from, so a change to `#why-playwright` means re-running `docs/site/shoot.mjs`.
- `lectures/spoken-talk/source.md` – **a short talk written out word for word**, and the only lecture here whose `> note:` blocks are a script rather than reminders. It exists so the cockpit's cue-card mode can be photographed doing its job: `#second-time` is a figure with three `step` blocks and three notes pinned to those beats with `> note: from N`, so one press moves a card and the projection in turn. `docs/site/shoot.mjs` takes four frames of that chunk for `in-the-room.html`, addressed by id – **its chunk ids are the contract with that script**, like `docs/artifact/figure-rules/`. Six chunks, views not tracked.
- `lectures/title-block/source.md` – **the title pair and the credit block, shown rather than described.** Six chunks, views not tracked. It wears `style: {headline: eyebrow, caps: on}`, all four credit ranks and `closing-credits: cover`, which is why it exists as a deck of its own: `lectures/decoration/` wears `cover: quote` and a deck has exactly one cover, so it can show the credit slots but never the eyebrow. Read it for what `title:` and `subtitle:` look like the other way up.
- `docs/artifact/` and `docs/site/figures.html` – **two pages, and the split is the point.** `docs/site/figures.html` is the *case* for the figure language; `docs/artifact/figures-you-write.html` is the *manual*. Both are produced by `docs/artifact/refresh-figures.mjs`, the only text that compiles a figure for publication, and its `--check` covers both – **run by `pages.yml` before it assembles the site and by `release.yml` beside the tracked-output check.** A staleness gate nothing runs is a comment. `docs/artifact/figure-rules/source.md` is the lecture both pages draw with, and it exists only to be compiled: CI lints it, so a compiler change that would spoil either page breaks it there first, where `node lint.js` can name the line. **Its chunk ids are the contract with the script – do not rename one without renaming it there too.** Everything else about the two pages, what the script owns and why the page fetches nothing at run time: `docs/artifact/README.md`.
- `docs/comparison.md` – how psi-slides differs from Beamer, reveal.js, Quarto, Marp and friends, in both directions. Published as a page on the site.
- `docs/site/DESIGN.md` – **the project site's design brief**: the one problem this site has that most do not (every picture on it is a picture of text), the stage-and-cue rules that follow from it, the one-frame-one-left-edge layout and the two layouts thrown away before it, the palette's single job, the two interactive devices, the list of what must not appear, and how to check a change – a contact sheet first, then per-container clipping, because page-level overflow does not see a box that clips its own content. Read it before changing `site.css` or either landing page. `desktop/DESIGN.md` is the same kind of document for the builder app.

## Conventions

- **En-dashes only.** Use `–` or `&ndash;` in all prose (docs, markdown, comments, lecture sources). Never em-dashes (`—`).
- When adding or renaming a chunk type, change it in **both** `build.js` and `lint.js` (and document the visual treatment in `PRD.md` §2.1).
- **The word is "type" everywhere a user reads it and `tag` everywhere the code says it.** Prose, headings and linter messages say *chunk type*; `VALID_TAGS`, `chunk.tag`, `data-tag`, `.tag-label` and `parseTagPrefix` keep the old name, because `data-tag` is in the published outputs and is what the search index and the speaker's lists read. Renaming the identifiers would change an output attribute for no reader's benefit. The `::: draw` `@tag` is a different thing altogether and stays a tag.
- Don't commit generated HTML outputs – they are regenerated per build and gitignored. Exception: **`lectures/tutorial/` and `lectures/diagrams/` track all four views**, and **`lectures/decoration/` tracks two, `audience.html` and `print.html`**. What the decoration reference demonstrates is what a slide looks like, so the projection and the printed document carry the whole of it; the notes view and the cockpit would add about 2 MB of tracked HTML and show nothing the other two do not. Rebuild and commit when any of the three sources changes. The release workflow fails if they are stale.
- `{#id}` attributes on chunks are **frozen once authored**. They are the anchor for cross-references, TOC entries, speaker-sync snapshots, and localStorage persistence. Don't renumber them reflexively when headings change.
- Shiki is loaded once and cached across `--watch` rebuilds; adding a new language means extending `SHIKI_LANGS` (and optionally `LANG_ALIAS`) at the top of `build.js`.
- **Math delimiters are `marked` extensions, and the inline rule must keep refusing to cross a backtick.** marked runs custom inline extensions *before* its own `codespan` tokenizer, so relaxing the content class lets a stray `$` in prose pair with one inside a following code span and swallow the delimiting backtick. This was a real regression, not a hypothetical: `a price of $5 and $10, ` + backtick-`$PATH` rendered as a formula reading `10, ` + backtick.
- **`viewHooks.consumeForward` / `consumeBack` are the only way a press is spent before it reaches the reveal counter.** The cockpit's cue cards (`K`; speaker.md §4.1) keep a cursor *in front of* `revealed[chunkId]`: `goForward` asks the hook first and only an unconsumed press reaches `advanceReveal`. They are hooks on `goForward` / `goBack`, not cases in the key map, so a key, the touch rail and a presenter's button all go through one cursor; a second path is how a click comes to count differently from a key. The cursor is never sent – the projection does not know the cards exist, and `--audience-only` against an older peer stays compatible. The card grammar is `cue-cards.mjs`, the third zero-dep module spliced into a live view as text (`window.PSI_CARDS`), for the reason `diagram-core.mjs` is: one text turns a `> note:` block into cards at build time and again in the browser for a rehearsal override, and its regexes stay out of every template literal. Which segment a note belongs to is `noteSegments()` in the parser, mirrored in `lint.js` (`note-in-empty-beat`); the two rules on top of the position – an empty segment slides back, notes only in the last segment are chunk notes on beat 1 – are in `PLAN-cue-cards.md` §2 and in `test/cue-cards.mjs`. **`> note: from N` pins a note to an advance by number** and is the escape hatch for the beats a position cannot name: a figure's `step` blocks are beats on the same counter but they sit inside one segment, so no `---` can be written between two of them. The cards are grouped by that number – the `consumed` count `applyReveal` uses and `::: overlay from N` shares – never by segment, which is why a diagram beat and a reveal interleave in one list.
- **The cockpit's element ids share one namespace with the lecture's chunk ids.** Every chunk is in `speaker.html` too, inside the mirror, so `getElementById('clock')` answers with whichever of the two comes first in the DOM – and `cuePlaceStage` moves the stage, which changes *which* that is mid-session. It cost the cue panel, whose id was also a tutorial chunk's: one drag stopped after 75 px and a `display: none` rule aimed at the chrome hid a slide. Chrome ids are therefore words a slide would not want (`#cue-panel`), and the pieces inside a panel are looked up through the panel (`cueRoot.querySelector`), not through the global id map.
- **`FOCUSABLE_SEL` in `AUDIENCE_JS` must stay a single constant.** Audience and speaker each resolve `figureIdx` against their own DOM, so the two windows focus different elements the moment their selectors disagree. Adding a focusable element type means editing that one string. **`FROM_SEL` beside it is the same rule for everything held to a beat by `from N`** (`.overlay-card[data-from], .dock[data-from]`): `chunkBeats`, `countSegments` and `applyReveal` read it, and a fourth reader spelled by hand is how two windows disagree about what arrives when.
- **Everything inlined lives in a template literal.** Three edit mistakes are easy and expensive there:
  - A raw backtick, **even inside a comment**, ends the literal. Throws at parse time. Never write one in `AUDIENCE_JS` / `SPEAKER_JS` / the CSS constants – name the identifier plainly instead.
  - An unterminated `/*` in a CSS block silently swallows every rule to the next `*/`. This used to ship broken, so `assertStylesheetsWellFormed()` runs on every `buildOnce` and turns it into a hard error.
  - **A regex backslash must be doubled.** `\s` inside a template literal is an escape the build resolves, so source `/\s+/g` emits `/s+/g` – a regex that matches the letter s. This ships silently: it cost a search index that had every `s` stripped out of its text. Write `/\\s+/g` in `build.js`, and grep the built HTML to confirm what was emitted.

  The first and third of these are now a gate: `node test/gates/run.mjs inlined` names the literal and the line in milliseconds, where a stray backtick otherwise costs a build and points the `SyntaxError` at the identifier *after* it. Run it before judging a build failure inside an inlined block. It does not replace reading the emitted HTML – a gate can see that an escape was doubled, not that the rule you wrote does what you meant.
- **Verifying an inlined change: never discard stderr, and check the output first.** `node build.js … 2>&1 >/dev/null` hides a `SyntaxError` and leaves the *previous* HTML on disk, so the browser then shows a stale build that looks like a change with no effect. After touching an inlined stylesheet or script, `grep -F` the new rule or function in the built HTML before judging it in the browser.
