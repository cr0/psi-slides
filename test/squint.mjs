/*
 * --squint says what a room would see. Four things about a slide are easy to
 * get wrong from the source and are the whole reason the command exists, so
 * this pins all four against a fixture deck that has one of each:
 *
 *   - a promoted bold, which the collapse turns into its own bullet under the
 *     paragraph and which the source shows as inline emphasis;
 *   - a reveal segment, which is not on the slide when you arrive on it;
 *   - a `::: slide` block, where the rule for the whole chunk changes;
 *   - a chunk whose entire content is a backdrop and an overlay, which are
 *     not inside `.chunk-body` at all. An extractor that walks only the body
 *     calls that slide empty, and the author's own review did exactly that.
 *
 * It also pins the two traps a hand-rolled walk fell into: `<style>` inside
 * an inlined `<svg>` is CSS and not prose, and `display: contents` (a card
 * row's list, the agenda's items, a divider's lead) is a box-less element
 * that `checkVisibility` calls invisible.
 *
 * And three facts a review asked this file for and did not get, all of them
 * the same shape - a construct reported by a name that leaves out the one
 * thing it is about:
 *
 *   - a two-cell list item, whose cells build.js writes with no whitespace
 *     between them because a grid supplies the gap. Read flat they come out
 *     as one word that is on no slide, and the review that met it went
 *     looking for a typo in the lecture;
 *   - a `::: side`, reported without the ratio it splits on;
 *   - a running agenda, reported without which of its items is live - which
 *     on a deck wearing `section: outline` is the only thing separating one
 *     divider's block in this file from the next one's.
 *
 * A fixture and not a lecture, for the reason math-focus.mjs gives: no
 * lecture in the repository has all four shapes in six chunks, and a spec
 * that walks a real deck to find them breaks when that deck is edited.
 *
 * This spec drives no page of its own - the command drives its own browser -
 * so it names a lecture only because the runner builds and opens one for
 * every spec. $PSI_CHROME is handed to the child so it starts the same
 * browser the suite did.

## title: {#cover}

# The four shapes {#shapes}

## principle: A claim that stands alone {.standard #claim}

The topic sentence is the whole of what the room reads here. The continuation
prose is not, and it carries a **promoted fragment of its own** that the
collapse keeps as a bullet.

## example: Two segments {.wide #segments}

The first segment is on the slide when you arrive.

---

The second segment arrives on the first press of the key.

## example: The author names the screen {.wide #explicit}

::: slide

- A list item the room reads
- And a second one

:::

This paragraph is the narration around that block and never reaches the
projection at all, whatever it says.

## figure: A picture with a caption on it {.full #picture}

::: backdrop dusk {.cover .invert}

::: overlay {.bottom-left .ink .standard}
**The caption is an overlay** and it lives outside the chunk body.
:::

## example: What stays whole {.wide #whole}

Code and pictures are never abridged.

x = 1
y = 2

> note: Two sentences of prompt for the lecturer. Neither of them is on the
> slide, and this file should say only how many words they are.

# What a name leaves out {#leftout}

## free: Two cells, and two panes {.wide #cells}

::: rows
- **Anonymity** comes from the others doing the same thing
- **Unlinkability** means two actions cannot be tied together
:::

::: side 2:1 {.middle}

The left pane is twice the width of the right one.

::: flip

The right one.

:::

## outline: Where we are {.wide #where}

The same list the dividers draw, with this part live.
