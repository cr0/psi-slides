/*
 * Beats: what one does, and writing one.
 *
 * Two things the panel could not say. It could stand on a beat and it could
 * write a `move` into one by dragging, but there was no way to add a step, no
 * way to add any other op, and – the one that cost the most – no way to see
 * which elements a beat is about without pressing Space and watching.
 *
 * That last one is not a reading of the source. `show @xor` is one line and
 * three elements; an edge appears because both its ends did; a container
 * appears because its members did. So the panel diffs the resolved state
 * either side of the beat, and this spec asserts on exactly that gap: more
 * elements listed than there are lines written.
