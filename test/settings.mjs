 * node test/settings.mjs
 *
 * The frontmatter and directive settings that decide how a lecture looks,
 * and the reasons they exist.
 *
 * It was called layout-compat.mjs when all it checked was the three
 * settings that reproduce the 1.0.0 layout. It has since grown to cover
 * autoplay, the label switches and the card-row vocabulary, and the name
 * had stopped describing it - which on a test file is worse than on most
 * things, because a name that undersells a file is a name that stops
 * people adding to it.
 *
 * The same failure has since moved from the name into the shape, and this
 * paragraph is the standing note about it. The file writes "put a source in
 * a temp dir, spawn build.js, read what came out" about a dozen times over:
 * four identical mk()s, refuses(), build2(), cover(), mask(), a row of
 * anonymous IIFEs, and then raw(), which is the general one and could have
 * written every one of the others. Consolidating gains no assertion and
 * loses none, which is why it has not been done - but a file with a dozen
 * ways to do one thing is a file people add a thirteenth to, which is
 * exactly what the rename was trying to prevent.
 *
 * So: write anything new with raw() and lintOf(), never a new helper. And if
 * you are here to extend this file substantially rather than to add one
 * assertion, consolidate downwards onto those two first - that is the moment
 * it is worth paying for, and no earlier.
 *
 * The settings that reproduce the 1.0.0 layout, and the reason they exist.
 *
 * From 1.0.0 the source format is the interface, and a lecture that laid out
 * a certain way should be able to lay out that way again. Exactly four
 * things have moved since 1.0.0 that a finished deck would notice, found by
 * diffing AUDIENCE_CSS and PRINT_CSS between the v1.0.0 tag and HEAD rather
 * than by reading commit titles:
 *
 *   1. the bundled sans           -> `fonts: {sans: Inter Tight}`
 *   2. text-wrap balance/pretty   -> `style: {wrap: none}`
 *   3. code ligatures             -> `ligatures: all`
 *   4. the look of a bold phrase  -> `style: {bold: accent-bold,
 *                                            print-bold: accent-bold}`
 *
 * There was a `layout: 1.0` umbrella over those three and it was removed.
 * One key naming a version reads as a promise that the engine can rebuild
 * any past release, and that promise is unbounded: every later change to a
 * shared stylesheet would have to be gated on a generation, the gates would
 * compose, and the set of untested combinations would grow with every
 * release. It also put the burden in the wrong place - an author would have
 * had to know which version their deck was authored against, and the project
 * would have had to publish a layout-version history beside the software
 * version. The settings give the same reachability and each is a
 * preference an author might want on its own merits, so the 1.0.0 look is a
 * short recipe rather than a mechanism.
 *
 * The recipe was verified once against the real thing, when it had three
 * lines: the same source built through `git show v1.0.0:build.js` and
 * through HEAD with all three set came out **pixel-identical**, 0 differing
 * pixels by `magick compare -metric AE` at 1440x810 deviceScaleFactor 2.
 * The fourth setting came later and was not re-measured; its one known
 * departure is that a promoted bullet under `accent-bold` now weighs the
 * deck's bold weight, which in a sans deck is 600 where 1.0.0 had a fixed
 * 500. That comparison cannot be a standing
 * test, because it needs a checkout of the old build; this file stands in for
 * it and guards the mechanism the comparison proved.
 *
 * Why here and not in test/gates/: a gate is zero-dependency by design and
 * runs on a bare checkout with no `npm install`, and this has to actually
 * build a lecture. Why not in test/run.mjs: that suite drives a browser and
 * builds lectures by slug out of lectures/, and none of what is asserted here
 * needs a browser or belongs in a tracked lecture.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertions are the *guards*. A future edit that drops the
 * `body:not([data-wrap=none])` wrapper from the text-wrap rules would leave
 * `style.wrap` silently doing nothing, and every outcome-shaped check here
 * would still pass.
