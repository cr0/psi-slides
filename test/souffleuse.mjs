/*
 * souffleuse · the live prompter, end to end
 *
 * The gate `test/gates/souffleuse.mjs` decides the restraint: twelve words,
 * one hint at a time, the cool-downs. What it cannot decide is whether the
 * three halves of the feature are wired to each other, because two of them
 * are not in the same process: an ear in the cockpit, a sidecar in Node
 * holding the key, and one socket between them. So this spec starts a real
 * `--watch --serve --prompter` build against a fake OpenRouter, opens the
 * served cockpit with a fake recogniser in it, and follows one whisper the
 * whole way – said in the room, sent over the socket, asked of the model,
 * judged by the policy, and painted on the strip.
 *
 * Its own fixture deck, for the third of the reasons test/README.md gives: a
 * cue is laid into a slide that is *still to come*, so the assertion needs a
 * deck whose slide order is known, and no lecture here would keep one.
 *
 * Two fakes, both in this file:
 *
 *  - **A fake OpenRouter**, an http server on loopback answering one route
 *    with scripted answers in order and keeping every request body. The
 *    sidecar reaches it through `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`, which exists for this.
 *  - **A fake `webkitSpeechRecognition`**, installed with addInitScript. It
 *    reports `available() → 'available'`, so the on-device path is taken and
 *    the badge stays down, and `window.__stt.final(text, seconds)` fires one
 *    final result at the adapter.
 *
 * **The clock is moved, not waited out.** The adapter stamps a segment with
 * the cockpit's own clock (`tStart`), the sidecar counts the cadence in those
 * seconds, and the policy keeps the first minute quiet. Waiting that out in
 * real time would make this spec two minutes of sleeping; `__stt.final(text,
 * 70)` pushes `tStart` back seventy seconds and the same arithmetic happens
 * at once. Everything else is polled, never slept on.

## title: A talk with a prompter in the box {#opening}

## free: What the room hears {#heard}

The ear sends what it heard, and the box answers or, almost always, stays quiet.

> note: @0:00 Open here, and keep one eye on the clock.

## free: The slide the card is for {#board}

A slide that is still to come, which is the only kind a cue may be laid into.

## free: The middle of the talk {#mid-one}

Three slides that exist to put the conclusion out of reach of the next three.

## free: Still the middle {#mid-two}

Because a card for the end has to be offerable from four slides away.

## free: The end of the middle {#mid-three}

After this one the conclusion, which is a cue target from anywhere.

## closing: The last word {#closing-words}

Nothing more to say, which is the prompter's usual answer too.
