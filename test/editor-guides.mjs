/*
 * The neighbour guides (editor.md §9.2).
 *
 * Snapping in a drawing tool aligns pixels. Here every snap target
 * corresponds to a statement the grammar can write, so the thing to assert is
 * never where the element landed – it is **what got written down**. A drag
 * that put the box in the right place by writing a number is a failure of
 * exactly the kind this feature exists to close, and on a screenshot it looks
 * perfect.
 *
 * So each of the sections below checks the same three things: the guide
 * appeared on the canvas, the status bar named the statement before the button
 * came up, and the source afterwards carries the *relation* rather than the
 * number it resolves to.
 *
 * The last two sections build a deck of their own, and the reason is the one
 * test/README.md gives for the other five that do. They need three elements
 * collinear on a bare `at`, so that a drag along that line has a `between a,b`
 * to propose and a nudge across it has a `.cx` to snap back to. `#look` in
 * lectures/diagrams used to be that shape by accident, being one tall figure
 * of six rows; splitting it into a figure per slide - which is what a room
 * needs, since "the bottom row of the catalogue" is not a reference anyone can
 * hold - took the shape away. A fixture says what the sections need instead of
 * depending on a lecture keeping a shape it was never drawn to keep.
 *
 * Drags are given in cells, not pixels, and converted through the canvas CTM –
 * the figures are laid out in grid units and the editor's zoom is fitted to
 * the frame, so a spec written in screen pixels would be measuring the
 * viewport.

// Three boxes on one axis at x=0 (a, mid, b) and two on another at x=3 (c, d).
//
// **`b` is placed `below a` and that is load-bearing.** `dgeGuidePairs` only
// pairs elements that are already related - the two ends of an edge, the outer
// members of an `align` or `spread`, or a node and the element its relative
// placement names. Five boxes on five bare `at` coordinates produce no pairs at
// all and therefore no `between` candidate, however neatly they line up. The
// relation between a and b is what makes the pair the guide is allowed to
// propose.
//
// `mid` is then strictly between them and bare, so a drag *along* that axis has
// a `between` to offer; `d` merely shares c's centre line with nothing on the
// far side, so a nudge *across* that axis can only answer `.cx`. Both dragged
// elements are bare `at`, which is the other precondition: an element already
// carrying a relation has one to lose and is left alone.
