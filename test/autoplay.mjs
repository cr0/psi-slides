/*
 * `::: draw autoplay N cycle` – the clock, and who is allowed to stop it.
 *
 * This spec exists because the feature shipped broken and nothing noticed.
 * `test/settings.mjs` asserted that `autoplay N` reaches the figure as
 * `data-autoplay`, which it did; no test ever ran the clock. The stop flag was
 * session-wide, and you reach a slide by pressing a key – so the keypress that
 * navigated to the figure retired the timer before the figure was on screen,
 * and autoplay could only ever run on a slide the deck happened to open on.
 * Jumping by address worked, which is why it looked fine when anyone checked.
 *
 * So the assertion that matters is not "a timer exists". It is **arrive at the
 * slide the way a lecturer does – by pressing a key – and see the beats move**,
 * and then that a key pressed once you are there still hands the deck back.
 *
 * It builds its own two-chunk deck for the reason test/README.md gives: the
 * shape it needs is a slide with autoplay standing *after* another slide, and
 * no lecture owes it that arrangement at a stable id.
