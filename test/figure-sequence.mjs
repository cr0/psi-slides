/*
 * A sequence keeps its rhythm.
 *
 * `sequence` owns exactly one thing – the vertical spacing – and the way it
 * fails is specific and invisible to every other check: a band that reserves
 * less room than the thing standing in it draws is still a correct figure by
 * the viewBox's reckoning, it just has a note box cutting through the label of
 * the message beneath it. That is precisely what the hand-written version of
 * this figure did, and it is the reason the statement exists.
 *
 * So this measures the emitted SVG the way figure-framing does, and asserts
 * the two halves of that promise on the two sequences in the lecture:
 *
 *  - nothing in a sequence overlaps anything else in it vertically. Every
 *    element is compared against every other, in page coordinates, with a
 *    tolerance of a pixel; the lifelines are excluded, because everything in
 *    the figure is meant to sit across them.
 *  - the generated names are the ones documented as the interface. An
 *    annotation hung off `wa-3` is an ordinary line in the lecture source, and
 *    it stops being one the day the scheme changes without the docs.
