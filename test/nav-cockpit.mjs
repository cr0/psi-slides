/*
 * The navigation mark in the speaker cockpit, and the one rule that has to
 * differ there. Blanking darkens the *projection*; the cockpit keeps working,
 * which is the whole point of the key. So the marks have to survive it in the
 * cockpit - that is exactly the moment a lecturer is navigating with the room
 * dark and cannot see the slide to judge where they are.
 *
 * `.blanked` goes on document.body in both views, so a rule written without
 * the view in it silently strips the marks from the one window that needed
 * them. Every other blanking rule in the stylesheet is already scoped this
 * way; this spec is what keeps a new one from forgetting.
