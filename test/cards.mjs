/*
 * Three things about the inside of a card that only a rendered page knows.
 *
 * 1. The two ways to open a card have to draw differently. The tutorial has
 *    documented since it was written that `- **A lead-in** its text` runs the
 *    bold into the sentence and `- **A heading**\` puts it on its own line,
 *    and for as long as it said so both drew the second way: the card was a
 *    flex column, which blockifies every child, so the bold was a flex item
 *    and the sentence after it an anonymous one. No stylesheet rule could
 *    have brought the run-in back. The property here is the difference, not
 *    a height: the same words written the two ways occupy a different number
 *    of line boxes.
 *
 * 2. The dash in front of a nested item has to sit on the middle of the line
 *    it belongs to. It was `top: 0.62em`, a guess at half a line, and the
 *    nested level is set at 0.88em with its own leading, so the dash rode
 *    high. Measured against the first line box rather than against a number,
 *    and measured again with the face, the size and the leading changed,
 *    because not depending on those is the whole point of the unit.
 *
 * 3. Reversed ink has to stay where the fill is. A `::: rows {.accent}` block
 *    puts the fill on the term alone, and the item that carried the reversal
 *    is display: contents and spans both columns - so the body beside the
 *    card was painted in the page colour on the page. Contrast, in all seven
 *    themes, because that is what the defect was.
 *
 * Its own fixture deck rather than a lecture: what is under test is a
 * comparison between two cards that differ in one character, and no lecture
 * has that pair except the tutorial's own demonstration of it, which is
 * prose an author is free to rewrite.
