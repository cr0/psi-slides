/*
 * ::: side {.middle} centres the shorter pane, and moves nothing else.
 *
 * The complaint it answers is a measurement: two lines of prose beside a tall
 * figure sit at the top of their half and leave most of it blank. The fix is
 * one declaration (align-items: center on the block) and the whole question
 * about it was one of granularity - should the word be per pane, since what
 * an author wants is usually the *prose* centred and the figure left alone?
 *
 * It should not, and this spec is the reason written as an assertion: a grid
 * row is as tall as its tallest item, so the tall pane already fills the row
 * and centring cannot move it. The block's switch therefore moves exactly the
 * short pane. That is asserted here in both directions - the short pane's
 * offset changes, the tall pane's does not, and the row's own height is the
 * same either way - so a future per-pane word would have to justify itself
 * against a case nothing can reach.
 *
 * Properties, never coordinates: the numbers below are all differences
 * between two boxes on the same page, so they hold at any window size, in any
 * theme, and at whatever the browser's default line height turns out to be.
 *
 * It builds its own deck for the reason math-focus does: no lecture in the
 * repository writes the word, because nothing did until now, and a fixture is
 * not a lecture.
