/*
 * beats-nested · a --- below the top level is a beat, in source order
 *
 * A `---` between two top-level blocks splits the chunk body into reveal
 * segments. Inside a ::: side pane, a card row, an overlay card or a
 * divider's body the same line cannot split anything - a wrapper cannot
 * straddle two segments - so the parser emits a marker (BEAT_MARK) and the
 * runtime hides every element sibling after it, up to the next marker in the
 * same parent, until its beat. One counter over the whole slide, in document
 * order, which is source order: the left pane's second paragraph, then the
 * right pane's first, then the card row written after the block.
 *
 * Only a browser can say whether that order holds, because it is the
 * runtime's walk (chunkBeats) that turns markers into beats, and the two
 * places it has to get right are exactly the two a static check cannot see:
 * that a marker inside a segment counts *between* the segments around it,
 * and that a marker inside an ::: overlay held to `from N` counts from N,
 * not from wherever the overlay layer sits in the DOM (after the body).
 *
 * Its own fixture deck: no lecture nests beats yet, and the assertion is
 * about a sequence, so the deck is written to have one.
