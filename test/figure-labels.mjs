/*
 * Where a label sits inside the thing that holds it.
 *
 * `left` means "as far left as this element allows", and what *allows* means
 * differs by kind: a shape's inner edge, and a free text's own extent, because
 * sizeOf gives a free text the bare glyph run with no padding at all. Insetting
 * both by the same number pushed every aligned free text 13px off its own box,
 * and on a `.paper` text – whose ground is drawn outwards from that box –
 * `left` came out flush against the right edge of its own ground.
 *
 * Two figures' worth of labels are measured against their own shapes, so the
 * assertion is the property rather than a coordinate: the same distance on
 * every element that claims the same side.
