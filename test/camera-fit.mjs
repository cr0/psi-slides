/*
 * The camera's fit test, and the box it is allowed to judge.
 *
 * One invariant, and it is the one `--check-fit` exists to police: **a chunk
 * whose content fits the frame has to be inside the frame.** A chunk taller
 * than the frame is walked instead, which is fine and deliberate; a chunk that
 * fits and is nonetheless clipped is a defect the room sees as a missing
 * sentence.
 *
 * It shipped broken. `focusCamera` measured the chunk *box* to decide whether
 * to centre or to walk, while the chunk box carries about 78 px of breathing
 * space above the heading - a deliberate part of the design. So a chunk whose
 * content was 793 px in an 800 px frame had a box of 871 px, failed the test,
 * had its head pinned at 5% and hung off the bottom of a frame it fitted
 * inside comfortably. Six of the tutorial's chunks were in that state at
 * 1280x800 and `--check-fit` had been reporting all six; nothing in the suite
 * asserted it, and `--check-fit` does not run in CI.
 *
 * The deck is a fixture with chunks of graded length so that some fit and some
 * do not at the viewport below, which is the arrangement the invariant needs
 * and which no lecture owes it at a stable size.
