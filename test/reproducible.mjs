/*
 * A built view is the same bytes whichever flags produced it.
 *
 * `release.yml` fails when a tracked view on disk does not match a rebuild,
 * and three lectures track their views. That check is only meaningful if a
 * rebuild is a function of the source alone - and for a while it was not.
 * `inlineSvgCounter` numbers the id prefix of every inlined SVG and used to
 * reset once per *build* rather than once per view, so the same figure came
 * out `psiINT-fig-6-` under `--audience-only` and `psiINT-fig-8-` under a full
 * build. Content identical, bytes different: a contributor who iterated with
 * a partial flag and committed produced a diff of pure id churn and a view
 * that read as stale to CI.
 *
 * The obvious check does not catch this, which is why this file says so out
 * loud. Building twice with the SAME flags and comparing tests
 * reproducibility within a flag set, and that already passed while the
 * defect was live. The defect is a dependency ON the flag set, so the
 * comparison has to cross one.
 *
 * No browser and no `npm install` beyond what build.js already needs: it
 * builds a fixture deck into a temp dir, twice, and compares two files.
