/*
 * W: the projection without the browser round it.
 *
 * This one is a spec rather than a gate for a reason no other navigation
 * spec has: the feature is shaped by a *browser policy*, and the only way to
 * know what the policy is, is to ask a browser. requestFullscreen is granted
 * to a press in the window that makes the call and refused to a request that
 * arrived by postMessage - measured here rather than assumed, because the
 * design (a hint on the projection, a click to spend) is only right for as
 * long as the refusal is real. If Chromium ever relaxes it, the first two
 * assertions below change and the arming path stops being needed; that is
 * exactly the news this spec exists to carry.
 *
 * Headless Chromium honours the API fully: document.fullscreenElement is set
 * and fullscreenchange fires. What it does **not** do is resize the viewport,
 * which Playwright pins - so the re-measure that a real frame change triggers
 * (auto-fit, --slide-h, slide-ref) cannot be observed here and is asserted in
 * test/auto-fit.mjs against a resize instead. Said out loud rather than left
 * as a gap somebody re-discovers.
 *
 * The lecture is `tutorial` because nothing here depends on a figure.
