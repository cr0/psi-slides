/*
 * What the emitted drawing *means*, as distinct from whether the source
 * parsed.
 *
 * This gate exists because a green acceptance test made a wrong drawing look
 * right. `accepts.mjs` carried `reg r <-> u` and asked only whether the block
 * compiled; it did, and it drew one arrowhead, because a sequence message kept
 * a one-bit arrow model (`headless: tok === '--'`) beside the four-state table
 * every direct edge reads. Parsing acceptance, build/lint agreement, emitted
 * semantics and beat-local runtime behaviour are four different contracts, and
 * three of the four had a gate.
 *
 * So every assertion here reads the SVG the compiler produced and asks what a
 * reader would see: which classes an element ended up with, whether an
 * arrowhead was actually drawn, which side of a line a label sits on. Where
 * the question is "did this default arrive", the fixture is paired with a
 * control that differs in exactly the one token under test – a bare removal
 * with no default to remove can appear to work while doing nothing, which is
 * how the expanding statements shipped losing every `{!class}` they were
 * handed.
 *
 * Numbers are compared for *difference*, never against a literal: text width
 * here is estimated rather than measured, so a coordinate baked into an
 * assertion pins the estimate rather than the meaning.
 *
 * One block at the end reads no SVG: the span table is what a source *means*
 * to the editor that rewrites it, and it is decided by the compiler alone. It
 * lives here rather than in a browser spec for the same reason as everything
 * else in this directory – it needs no page to answer.
