/*
 * The bits every fast gate needs: a diagram compiler with the four Node-only
 * leaves stubbed out, a bridge that runs the same source through `lint.js`,
 * and the report helper.
 *
 * Why these gates exist at all, and why they are not in `test/run.mjs`. The
 * browser suite covers the things that only break in a built page and takes
 * about four minutes to say so. Everything the *compiler* decides – which
 * lines it refuses, which it accepts, what it says when it refuses – is
 * reachable from Node in milliseconds, and CLAUDE.md names the failure these
 * gates guard: `lint.js` deliberately mirrors the parsing contract by hand,
 * and a linter laxer than the build merges green and fails every later build.
 * CI lints two lectures it did not used to build, which is exactly where that
 * bites.
 *
 * Deliberately no test framework, and deliberately no browser: the whole
 * point of this entry point is that it needs neither. It also needs no
 * `npm install` – `diagram-core.mjs` and `lint.js` are both zero-dependency,
 * so these gates run on a bare checkout.
 *
 * The report helper is a copy of the one in `test/harness.mjs`, not an import
 * of it: that file loads `playwright-core` at module scope, and pulling a
 * browser binding into a gate whose selling point is that it needs no browser
 * would undo the thing being bought. Fifteen lines, same output shape.

// contains them and they are not what any of these gates is about. `abs` has
// to be truthy for `imageAspect` to be consulted at all, or every image line
// in the corpus answers with "cannot read the asset's proportions" and the
// warning census measures the stub rather than the source.
// `extra` replaces individual leaves, for the one gate that compiles figures
// out of the corpus rather than out of its own fixtures: a stubbed proportion
// is the right answer for a made-up `image` line and the wrong one for a real
// avatar, whose box then stands where the lecture does not draw it.
