/*
 * Every way a source.md names a picture, held against the two readers that
 * have to see all of them.
 *
 * The build inlines an image referenced four ways: Markdown (`![](path)`,
 * `![](<path>)`, `![a][ref]` with its definition, and `![](fig-id)`),
 * a ::: draw `image` statement, a `::: backdrop`, and the `cover-image:` /
 * `closing-image:` frontmatter keys. Two pieces of build.js read that set for
 * different purposes - `scanReferencedImages`, which weighs it against the
 * per-image inline cap and refuses the build, and `collectImageRefs`, which is
 * what `--optimize-images` works from - and until this gate they were two
 * regex sets in one file. Only one of them had the last three forms. So a real
 * keynote whose only oversized assets were a backdrop and a cover-image was
 * refused by `assertInlinable`, with a message recommending
 * `--optimize-images`, and that verb answered "Nothing to do: no referenced
 * PNG/JPEG asset is 512 KB or larger" about the very files the build had just
 * refused. A dead end the author cannot get out of by reading either message.
 *
 * Three things are asserted, and the first is the one that drifts:
 *
 *   1. both readers go through `collectDecorationImageRefs` - a text check,
 *      because a second regex set added beside one of them is exactly how this
 *      happened the first time;
 *   2. that collector finds all three forms, skips a fenced example (it feeds
 *      a verb that DELETES the original after converting it, and the rewrite
 *      below skips fences, so a collector that did not would delete a file and
 *      leave the only line naming it unedited), and skips nothing else;
 *   3. `rewriteAssetRef` rewrites all four spellings of a converted path,
 *      quoted or not, and leaves a fenced one alone.
 *
 * build.js cannot be imported - it calls `main()` at module scope - so the
 * three functions are lifted out of it as text and evaluated, the way
 * `test/settings.mjs` lifts the collapse helpers out of a built page. All
 * three are pure string work over one argument, which is what makes that
 * honest here: nothing is stubbed, the gate runs the shipped code.
