/*
 * Every `::: draw` block in the repository still compiles.
 *
 * The four sources below hold every figure the project has: the construct
 * reference, thirty-six real lecture slides, the lecture the standalone
 * teaching page is compiled from, and the tutorial. Between them they are the
 * only body of figures written by hand rather than for a test, which makes
 * them the only thing that can catch a refusal that is *too strict* at scale.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not do.
 *
 * It does not snapshot the emitted SVG. The scratch version did, against a
 * committed 620 KB baseline, and that was the right tool for one migration and
 * the wrong one to keep: the baseline churns whenever a layout constant moves,
 * it cannot tell an improvement from a regression, and text width here is
 * *estimated* rather than measured, so the numbers in it are not the numbers a
 * browser paints anyway. The properties a snapshot was standing in for are
 * asserted directly, from a real browser with real metrics, by
 * `test/figure-framing.mjs`, `test/figure-labels.mjs` and
 * `test/figure-sequence.mjs`.
 *
 * It does not build the lectures. `node build.js` on all six is the CI step
 * next to this one and it costs minutes; this costs milliseconds because it
 * goes straight to the compiler. The two are complementary – the build catches
 * things no compiler gate can, such as a backtick landing inside one of
 * build.js's template literals.

// A ratchet, not a snapshot. Three of the warnings below are deliberate – the
// construct reference draws a box too narrow for its label on purpose, and the
// figure-rules lecture carries two edges a degree and a half off the axis – so
// the number is here to say "no *new* kind of complaint appeared", and it is
// one line to raise when a figure earns one. Each warning is printed, so a
// failure names itself. (The two decks were named the other way round here for
// as long as nobody read the printout beside the ceiling.)
//
// It was briefly 5. The label-clearance check found its first defect on the
// first source it was run against - `lectures/tutorial` `#diagram` put the
// words `encrypted` and `recoded` between boxes 40 px apart, and they measure
// 71 and 57, so the boxes at either end clipped both. The figure was redrawn
// at `gap 2.1` in the same session, so the ceiling never had to hold a known
// defect open. Raise it for a warning a figure has earned, not for one it has.

// it is recorded with its problems rather than dropped, or a stale spelling
// would silently shrink the corpus.
// **Each lecture's figures compile the way that lecture compiles them.** A
// block is not the whole input: `draw-defaults` in the frontmatter is a layer
// under every figure in the deck, and an `image` line's box comes from the
// asset's own proportions. Compiled without either, a figure here is a figure
// no reader has ever seen – `lectures/network-security` sets `default text
// {.small}`, so every label in it was measured a quarter too large, and
// `lectures/diagrams`' avatars are 100x120 against a stub's 1.6, so they stood
// a third too tall. Both produced overlap warnings about geometry the build
// does not draw, which is exactly the kind of noise a ratchet must not carry.
