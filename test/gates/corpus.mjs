/*
 * Every `::: draw` block in the repository still compiles.
 *
 * The four sources below hold every figure the project has: the construct
 * reference, thirty-six real lecture slides, the lecture the standalone
 * teaching page is compiled from, and the tutorial. Between them they are the
 * only body of figures written by hand rather than for a test, which makes
 * them the only thing that can catch a refusal that is *too strict* at scale.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not do.
 *
 * It does not snapshot the emitted SVG. The scratch version did, against a
 * committed 620 KB baseline, and that was the right tool for one migration and
 * the wrong one to keep: the baseline churns whenever a layout constant moves,
 * it cannot tell an improvement from a regression, and text width here is
 * *estimated* rather than measured, so the numbers in it are not the numbers a
 * browser paints anyway. The properties a snapshot was standing in for are
 * asserted directly, from a real browser with real metrics, by
 * `test/figure-framing.mjs`, `test/figure-labels.mjs` and
 * `test/figure-sequence.mjs`.
 *
 * It does not build the lectures. `node build.js` on all six is the CI step
 * next to this one and it costs minutes; this costs milliseconds because it
 * goes straight to the compiler. The two are complementary – the build catches
 * things no compiler gate can, such as a backtick landing inside one of
 * build.js's template literals.

// first source it was run against - `lectures/tutorial` `#diagram` put the

// 71 and 57, so the boxes at either end clipped both. The figure was redrawn
// at `gap 2.1` in the same session, so the ceiling never had to hold a known
