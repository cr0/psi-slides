/*
 * node test/gates/run.mjs             all gates
 * node test/gates/run.mjs corpus      only the gates whose name contains "corpus"
 *
 * The fast half of the suite: everything about the figure language that can be
 * decided without a browser. It compiles diagram source through
 * `diagram-core.mjs`, runs the same source through `lint.js`, and asserts the
 * two agree – in seconds, on a bare checkout, with no `npm install` and no
 * Chromium, because both of those files are zero-dependency by design.
 *
 * Thirteen gates, and they prove thirteen different things – which is worth stating
 * because a green run summarised as one number hid a wrong drawing behind a
 * passing parse:
 *
 *   refusals   build and lint agree on what is refused, and on what is not
 *   accepts    every construct the grammar offers still parses
 *   semantics  the emitted SVG means what the source says, and what the
 *              source means to the editor that rewrites it
 *   corpus     every block in the repository still compiles, and each file
 *              holds exactly the number of blocks it is said to
 *   step-classes  which classes a beat can actually carry, derived from the
 *              compiler's own table rather than restated
 *   inlined    the two characters that mean something else inside one of
 *              build.js's template literals: a raw backtick, which ends the
 *              literal, and a single-backslash regex escape, which the
 *              literal eats and which therefore ships
 *   tails      the one {…} tail parser and the ::: draw opener parser in
 *              tails.mjs: every code they can emit, the written-default rule,
 *              and the formatter round trip
 *   frontmatter  the top-level key set, held across build.js and lint.js in
 *              the direction that matters: a key the build reads and the
 *              linter does not know is a false warning on a valid deck
 *   legacy-draw-syntax  the old braced ::: draw opener stays out of every
 *              source.md, and every other survivor of it is on a reviewed
 *              allowlist
 *   cue-cards  the note-to-cards grammar in cue-cards.mjs, rule by rule,
 *              and that the module reaches the speaker page as
 *              window.PSI_CARDS with every export on it
 *   xheight    every text face in BUNDLED_FONTS carries the measured
 *              x-height that sizes inline code against the prose around
 *              it, and the roster agrees with the JSON it was copied from
 *   identity   the accent arithmetic in colour.mjs, against the ratios
 *              build.js already states in prose, the duplicate chain in
 *              diagram-core.mjs, and the document paper lint.js measures
 *              against
 *   frame      every state that covers the stage is in FRAME_HIDDEN_STATES,
 *              derived from the stylesheet rather than restated - the panels
 *              from their own #x.hidden rule, the dimmers from a property
 *              sweep over every selector that touches #stage
 *
 * `test/run.mjs` is the other half and stays separate: it builds and serves
 * the lectures, launches a browser and takes about four minutes. Splitting
 * them is the point. These gates are cheap enough to run on every push, which
 * is what the browser suite can never be, and they cover the one thing CI
 * could not see before – the hand-mirrored parsing contract in `lint.js`
 * drifting from the compiler it mirrors.
