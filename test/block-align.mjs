/*
 * Where a code block, a figure and a display formula sit across the slide.
 *
 * All three have been centred since the tool shipped, and centred is right
 * when the block is the slide. It is wrong when the block is one step of an
 * argument: a paragraph, then a formula, then a paragraph reads as three
 * blocks on three axes. `style: {blocks: left}` and the per-chunk
 * `.blocks-left` put all three on the prose's own axis.
 *
 * This is a browser spec and not a settings check because the three move by
 * three different mechanisms and none of them is legible in the stylesheet.
 * The pre is centred by a breakout - left: 50% plus a translate - so its box
 * moves and the listing inside it was left-aligned all along. The figure is
 * a flex column and its align-items moves the artwork and the caption inside
 * a box that does not move. The formula is KaTeX's own text-align, two rules
 * deep. Reading the CSS tells you all three rules exist; only a layout says
 * whether the left edges actually line up.
 *
 * The second thing it measures is the one number that could quietly be
 * wrong. A left-aligned pre keeps the breakout width, so its max-width is
 * computed from where the column starts rather than from the slide's middle:
 * 0.36 x slide + half the column. If that arithmetic is off, a wide listing
 * runs past the slide's padding and off the projection - which no assertion
 * about a left edge would ever notice. It is checked at both chunk widths
 * that bracket the range and at two window sizes, because a formula that
 * happens to agree at one size is not arithmetic.
 *
 * This spec builds its own decks. No lecture in the repository sets either
 * switch - the tutorial is the author's and is edited continuously - and the
 * pair only means anything when the same content is shown both ways.
