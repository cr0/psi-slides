/*
 * transition · a slide change with and without the visible pan
 *
 * `transition: pan | cut | fade` is the one viewer default whose whole
 * subject is what happens *between* two states, so nothing static can
 * settle it: the claims are about frames. Each mode is walked over the same
 * three slides and sampled once per animation frame - the stage's transform,
 * the stage's opacity, and each chunk's own opacity - and the trace is what
 * the assertions read.
 *
 *   pan   the camera travels: many distinct transforms, and it is still
 *         moving after the first frame. Unchanged from before the key.
 *   cut   the camera is at its final transform on the first frame after the
 *         press, and the arriving slide is at full opacity there too.
 *   fade  no two transforms while anything is visible - the jump is taken in
 *         a frame where the stage is at zero - and never two slides painted
 *         at once. "Painted" is the stage's opacity times the chunk's,
 *         because a chunk at 1 inside a stage at 0.2 is not on the screen.
 *
 * Its own fixture deck, for the reason test/README.md gives for the others:
 * the property is about three plain consecutive slides and a press between
 * them, which every real lecture has and none of them holds still - a deck
 * edited for its own sake would move the numbers here for no reason. The
 * deck also carries a two-beat chunk and one taller than the frame, because
 * the thing most easily broken by "make the camera instant" is the motion
 * that is NOT a slide change: a reveal still has to glide, and a chunk taller
 * than the screen still has to walk down as it grows.
