/*
 * Clicking a display formula has to make more of it visible, not less.
 *
 * The overlay enlarges a focused formula by setting type - 0.12 of the slide
 * height, 108px at 1440x900, about three times what it had on the slide - and
 * then the card it sits on caps at 98vh with overflow-y hidden. Type does not
 * know how tall the screen is, so for anything with rows the two rules pull
 * against each other and the card wins: eight rows of an aligned block
 * measured 435px on the slide, fully visible, and 1285px inside an 882px card
 * once focused. A third of the formula was simply gone, on the gesture whose
 * whole purpose is to show it better.
 *
 * Scrolling looks like the obvious answer, because the code block beside it
 * has overflow: auto - and it is not one here. The overlay's wheel handler
 * preventDefaults and zooms, and a drag pans, so a scrollbar inside the card
 * can only be reached by dragging the bar, and on a touchscreen not at all.
 * The enlargement stops at the edge of the screen instead.
 *
 * This spec builds its own deck. No lecture in the repository has a formula
 * with more than one row - every display block in all five is a single line -
 * so nothing that ships can reach the case, which is most of why it shipped.
 * A fixture is not a lecture and does not belong in lectures/, and
 * test/settings.mjs, which is where ad-hoc sources normally live, drives no
 * browser.
