# Designing a figure

How to lay out a figure so a room reads it in one look, written as instructions
rather than principles. Every rule has three parts: what to do, what the eye is
doing that makes it work, and a wrong/right pair in real DSL syntax you can copy.

It is addressed to two readers at once, a person and a language model, and both
should be able to work straight down it. The grammar itself is in the
`psi-slides-figures` skill (`.claude/skills/psi-slides-figures/SKILL.md`) and
in working syntax in `lectures/diagrams/source.md`; this file is about what to
build with it.

The name for all of this is the Gestalt principles: a short list of things human
vision does before you have decided to look at anything. You do not get to opt
out of them. A figure either uses them or fights them.

---

## Before the first line: is a figure the right answer?

**Not everything is better drawn.** Colin Ware sets four lines of pseudo-code –
read a line, put it in capitals, write it out again – beside a flow chart of the
same loop, and the pseudo-code wins by a distance: it takes less work to read and
less ink to print. His conclusion is the sentence to carry away – *"Diagrams
should be used to express structural relationships among program elements,
whereas words should be used to express detailed procedural logic."*

What that leaves for a figure is everything a sentence has to be re-read to
hold. Ware's counter-example is six statements about a management hierarchy –
Jane is Jim's boss, Anne works for Jane, Anne is Mary's boss – which nobody can
keep in their head and everybody reads off a tree at a glance. A trust chain, a
network segment, a protocol exchange, a table of who answers what: that is
structure, and structure is what this grammar is for. A procedure whose steps
are conditions and assignments is prose, or it is code. A code listing will
serve it better than any number of diamonds, and so will a `::: script` block –
the directive that says "this part of the chunk is what I say, not what the
slide shows".

**This cuts against two figures in this repository.** The
flowchart in `lectures/diagrams` (`#flowchart`) and its cut-down twin in
`docs/artifact/figure-rules` (`#fc`) are packet-forwarding decisions, which is
exactly the case Ware's rule is aimed at. They are there to demonstrate a
*shape* the grammar can draw. Read them as specimens of the construction, not
as an argument that the construction was the right choice for that content.
When a real lecture wants a flow chart, write the pseudo-code first and see
whether the picture is still worth drawing beside it.

**If it is, answer Matt Carter's eight questions before drawing anything.**
They take a minute and they settle most of the figure:

1. What is absolutely necessary to show?
2. What is not necessary to show?
3. What is most important, and should be emphasised?
4. What is not important, and should be secondary to the main message?
5. What are the relationships between the individual elements?
6. Does the figure need a precise depiction of time?
7. Does it need a precise depiction of distance?
8. Which symbols have to stay consistent throughout?

Questions three and four are the prominence words – `emph`, `dim`, `ghost` – and the
beat order below.
Question five decides between an `edge`, a `container` and mere proximity, which
is rules 1 to 3. Six and seven are the two that get skipped, and they are the
two that bite: if time is precise, the left-to-right order is carrying it and
nothing may be moved for tidiness; if distance is *not* precise, no gap may be
sized as though it were. Question eight is rule 4, written down once for the
whole lecture rather than per figure.

---

## 1. Group by distance, not by label

**Do:** make the gaps *inside* a group visibly smaller than the gaps *between*
groups. A factor of two is enough; a factor of three is unmistakable.

**Why:** proximity is the fastest grouping cue there is, and it fires before
anyone reads a word. If your spacing says one thing and your labels say another,
the spacing wins and the labels look like a mistake.

**A `gap` is comparable with any other `gap`, whichever way it points.** That is
not a small promise, and it is what makes the factor of two above something you
can write rather than something you have to look at. Every number in a figure is
in that figure's own grid units, and there are two families of them. A number
that **addresses** the grid is axis-keyed, because a grid cell is not square:
`at`, `w`, `h`, `offset` and every nudge count cells across and cells down. A
number that states a **clearance** is square, and its ruler is one row – `gap`,
`pad`, `space`, and a `dot`'s `r`. So `gap 0.5` between two boxes side by side
and `gap 0.5` between two stacked on top of each other draw the same distance,
and the rule above is arithmetic rather than judgement. A clearance can also be
written in label heights – `gap 1.5lh`, `pad 0.6lh` – which is the ruler every
rule in this file is stated in, and the one to use in a `draw-defaults` layer
that reaches figures with different grids. A bare number stays a count of rows.

**Write the gap that means something and leave the other one off.** A placement
with no `gap` is not a placement with no clearance: it gets one base label of
paper, and 1.6 of them where an `edge` joins the two, which is an arrowhead plus
as much shaft again. That default is in labels rather than in rows precisely so
it does not change when you change the opener. So the number worth writing is
the *wide* one – the gap that says "these two are not a pair" – and a row that
wants no more than to be legible wants no number at all.

```
# wrong: four boxes, one rhythm, and only the words say which two belong together
box a "Switch"  at 0,0
box b "Router"  right of a gap 0.5
box c "Resolver" right of b gap 0.5
box d "Webserver" right of c gap 0.5

# right: the pair is a pair before you read it, and only the wide gap is written
box a "Switch"  at 0,0
box b "Router"  right of a
box c "Resolver" right of b gap 0.9
box d "Webserver" right of c
```

## 2. Enclose what a distance cannot say

**Do:** use `container` for a trust boundary, a network segment, a DMZ, a
machine that holds several parts. Do not try to say it with a bigger gap.

**Why:** common region beats proximity. A line drawn around things binds them
even when they are far apart, and even when something else sits between them.

```
# wrong: the home network is "the stuff on the left", and nothing says so
box a "A" at 0,0
box b "B" right of a gap 0.3
box r "Router" right of b gap 1.6

# right
box a "A" at 0,0
box b "B" right of a gap 0.3
box r "Router" right of b gap 1.6
container home "Home network" over a,b pad 0.4 {.dashed}
```

A `container` is only as visible as its members and re-fits when they move, so
it needs no `show` of its own and no maintenance when the figure changes.

**An area that has to stand before anything is in it is a `zone`.** A
container appears with its members; a zone holds from the first beat, is
painted under everything whatever line it is written on, and carries its
caption in a corner, which is what a region that fills up as the talk goes on
wants. Place what stands in it `in` it – one element with `in home`, a run of
peers with `row a, b in home` – and a zone written without `w` or `h` wraps
what is placed in it. Only `in` is membership: `right of a` on a third box runs
on out of the area.

```
# right: the region stands from beat 0, and what is in it is placed in it
zone home at 0,0 "Home network"
row a, b in home
box a "A"
box b "B"
box r "Router" right of home gap 0.8
```

## 3. Keep edges for relations

**Do:** draw an `edge` when two things are actually connected. When you only
want to point at something, use a leader: `-- target` on a `text`.

**Why:** uniform connectedness is the strongest grouping cue of all – stronger
than proximity, stronger than colour. An arrow used as a pointing finger claims
a relationship that is not there, and the room will look for it.

```
# wrong: an arrow that means "this label is about that box"
box  sw "Switch" at 0,0
text n  "learns MAC addresses" right of sw gap 1.2
edge n -> sw

# right: a leader is a thin muted stub and reads as an annotation
box  sw "Switch" at 0,0
text n  "learns MAC addresses" right of sw gap 1.2 -- sw {.small .muted}
```

## 4. One tone, one role, all the way through

**Do:** decide at the start of a lecture what each fill means, write it down,
and do not reuse a tone for a second meaning in the same figure.

**Why:** similarity groups things that are nowhere near each other. Two boxes in
the same tone are claimed to be the same *kind* of thing, and the claim is made
across the whole figure whether you meant it or not.

The assignment used by `lectures/network-security` – a good default for any
security lecture:

| Class | Means |
|---|---|
| `.tone-1` | infrastructure: switch, router, resolver, firewall |
| `.tone-2` | a legitimate host or participant |
| `.tone-3` | payload: packets, protocol fields, records |
| `.tone-4` | the one thing this beat is about (a solid fill, so use it sparingly) |
| `.accent` | the attacker and the attack traffic |
| `.dim` | present in the picture, not part of this scene |
| `.muted` | scaffolding: grid lines, zone outlines, annotations |

A muted line has two quieter steps, and the build already uses both: a
`zone`'s outline is `.dashed .muted`, a `plot`'s grid `.dotted .muted`. The
dotted one is drawn at the plain line's weight rather than the muted one, so
its dots are large enough to reach their colour on a projector.

Two classes from the same slot on one element is an **error**: the build refuses
the line. A **slot** is a group of classes that answer one question - which
fill, which outline, which typeface - and an element takes one class from each,
so writing two is the line giving two answers to one question. One pair from
two slots is refused as well, because the first deletes what the second draws
on: `.bare` takes the outline off, so `{.bare .dashed}` draws no outline at
all. A dashed outline with no fill is `{.clear .dashed}` – `.clear` takes the
fill off and keeps the line.
`.tone-4` with `.accent` is not a slot conflict but is still usually a mistake:
the fill is the accent, so accent ink on it is invisible. `.turn` with `.left`
or `.right` on a node label is the other one: a turned label is centred on its
origin across the direction it reads, so those two have nothing left to align.
`.top` and `.bottom` do still move a turned label. Those two are **warnings**
rather than errors, and they are the compiler's rather than the linter's,
because both are authorable on purpose – a later `style` step that takes the
fill off turns an inert `.accent` into the ink. The build only complains where
the pair is live in every beat.

**Which of them may cover a large area is a separate question.** Strong colour
belongs on small marks, thin lines and small areas, weak colour on large ones
(Ware). So `.tone-4` is right for a marker, a cell, one column of a chart or
one box in a row, and wrong for a full-height panel, where `.tone-2` with a
`.top` caption says the same thing without taking the figure over.

## 5. Let a step say what belongs together

**Do:** tag the elements of a beat and reveal the tag, rather than listing names.

**Why:** things that appear together are read as one thing (common fate). The
tag makes the source say the same thing the picture does, and it survives you
adding a ninth element to the group.

```
# wrong: correct, and it tells no one anything
step attack
  show e, e-web, reply1, reply2, note-spoof

# right
step attack
  show @attack
```

Most edges need no `show` at all. **An edge is only as visible as its two ends**,
a `container` only as visible as its members, a `text` with a leader only as
visible as what it points at. Reveal the boxes and the wiring follows.

That is the default, and naming the element overrides it. An arrow that should
arrive a beat *after* both the boxes it joins – the reply, the escalation, the
answer – gets a `show` of its own, and an outline that should stand around its
whole set before the set has filled up gets one too.

```
# the arrow arrives on its own beat, after both ends are already there.
# An edge has no name until you give it one: the word before the from-end.
edge reply srv -> cli "200 OK"
step the-request
  show srv, cli
step the-answer
  show reply
```

Write the override only where the downhill reading is wrong. A `show` on every
element is the wrong-hand column of this rule again.

## 6. Give a label a ground when it sits on a line

**Do:** any text that overlaps a line, a grid, or a filled area gets a fill class
and some `pad`. `.paper` is the one that knocks a hole in what is behind it.

**Why:** figure and ground. Type on top of a line is read as texture, not as
words, and on a projector at the back of a room it is simply lost.

```
# wrong: the subnet label lies across the link and neither survives
text lbl "10.1.1.0/24" between sw,rt

# right: .paper punches the line out behind the word
text lbl "10.1.1.0/24" between sw,rt pad 0.12 {.paper .small}
```

This is also why `.paper` exists as a class at all: a box already defaults to it,
but a free `text` has no ground until you ask for one.

**And where the label sits inside its own room is four more words.** `.left`,
`.right`, `.top` and `.bottom` mean "as far that way as this element allows" –
its inner edge, not its border. A tall element with a short label is what they
are for: without them the word floats in the middle of a bar with empty space
above and below it.

```
# wrong: the label floats in the middle of a tall panel
box zone "TRUSTED" at 0,0 w 1.2 h 2.4 {.tone-2}

# right: it sits at the top, where the eye enters the shape
box zone "TRUSTED" at 0,0 w 1.2 h 2.4 {.tone-2 .top}
```

They combine with `.turn`, which is how a firewall bar gets a label at all: the
word reads up the bar, and `.top` decides which end it starts from.

With more than one line they move the *block*, so `.bottom` puts the last line
on the inner edge. On a free `text` placed at a coordinate, `.left` and `.right`
also say which edge stands on it: `text l "zu Hause" at haus.left+0.2,haus.top+0.35
{.left}` puts the first letter 0.2 in from the frame, and a column of `.left`
labels sharing one x lines up with no further word (`anchor center` asks for
the centring back). They apply to a box, a dot and a free text, and to nothing
else: writing one of them on an edge, a container or a brace is an error rather
than a class that quietly does nothing, because all three place their label by
their own statement. An **edge** says which side of the line its label sits on
with the `side` option instead – `side top` / `side bottom` beside a horizontal
edge, `side left` / `side right` beside a vertical one, and `.turn` stands the
words on end beside it. Which pair applies depends on the direction the edge
ended up running, so naming the pair that runs *along* it is a build warning
rather than a parse error – and the direction is read off **the beats the edge
is on screen**, so an arrow revealed by the very step that levels its two ends
is judged level. An edge that genuinely changes axis while it is visible is
warned about by beat, because there the word acts on one press and not on the
next. A brace takes `side <word>` too, for the same
concept: which side of the thing the spine sits on.

**On an edge, a label is either *on* the line or *beside* it, and the choice
says what kind of label it is.** A fill class with no side named puts the words
on the line and knocks the line out behind them; naming a side lifts them clear
and carries the ground with them.

- **On the line** for a token that *identifies* the line: a sequence number, a
  port, a message type, a protocol name. It belongs to the line the way a street
  sign belongs to the street, and the line running out of both sides of it says
  so.
- **Beside the line** for a phrase that *describes what travels along it*:
  "only after the handshake", "dropped silently", "plaintext". A phrase with a
  line through it is read as two fragments before it is read as a sentence.

A label beside the line is lifted clear of it at its midpoint. Where the same
route comes back across the words further along – an elbow's outer run, a
curve, a `via` that doubles back – the build knocks the line out behind the
glyphs, and only there, so you write nothing for it.

A `sequence` message is the one place you do not make this choice: its label is
a phrase, it always sits beside the line, and it always carries a ground,
because a lifeline crosses every label in such a figure. Write `.clear` to take
the ground off and `{.tone-2}` to colour it; writing `.paper` says what is
already true.

```
# wrong: one convention for the tokens and another for the phrases, in one
# figure – the reader has to decide what kind each label is before reading it
edge a -> b "1"                     side top
edge b -> c "carries the session key" {.paper .small}

# right: numbers ride on the line, phrases sit beside it, all the way through
edge a -> b "1"                     {.paper .small}
edge b -> c "carries the session key" side top {.small .muted}
```

**Either way, the words need a line long enough to hold them.** A label is
centred on its edge and the boxes at both ends are painted *after* it, so a
label wider than the paper between their near faces is not tight – it is
clipped, and what reaches the back of the room is the middle of the word. A
gap nobody wrote already makes that room: between two boxes side by side that
a labelled edge joins, the default widens to the words plus their padding. So
this is a trap you walk into by writing a number, and the build says so and
gives you both numbers, because the fix is a number.

```
# wrong: on a 126x38 grid, gap 1.05 leaves 40px of paper and "encrypted" needs 71
box src "Sender"
box mix "Mix"      right of src gap 1.05
edge src -> mix "encrypted"

# right: no gap written, and the default is as wide as the label it carries
box src "Sender"
box mix "Mix"      right of src
edge src -> mix "encrypted"
```

Taking the written `gap` off is the usual answer, widening it the next, and
shortening the label the third. `side top` is an answer only where the two elements are short enough for
the words to pass over them – a phrase lifted 14px off the line is still inside
a box 38px tall, and the build will say so again.

**A phrase that describes a wire belongs to the wire, so place it against the
wire.** An edge has a coordinate of its own - `w1.cx`, `w1.cy` - and takes
`above`, `below`, `left of` and `right of` like anything else. Pinning the
phrase to one of the boxes at either end looks equivalent and is not: it keeps
its distance from the box and loses it from the line the moment a fraction or a
height changes, and nothing warns you.

```
# wrong: the phrase is measured from the Client, and the wire is not
edge f1 cl.right:0.14 -> sv.left:0.14 "1" pad 0.1 {.paper}
text m1 "ClientHello" at cl.right+1.0,cl.top+0.16 {.small .muted}

# right: the phrase is measured from the wire it names
edge f1 cl.right:0.14 -> sv.left:0.14 "1" pad 0.1 {.paper}
text m1 "ClientHello" at f1.cx-0.55,f1.cy-0.26 {.small .muted}
```

Raising those two boxes from `h 3.0` to `h 4.2` leaves the second label 13.5px
from its line, where it was authored, and drags the first one out to 22.3px.
Note that this is also the reason to give such an edge a name – the word before
its from-end, `edge f1 cl…` – because an edge has no name until you write one,
and a wire nobody can name is a wire nothing can be placed against.

Pick the convention once per figure and keep it. Both readings are legible on
their own; a figure that mixes them makes the reader classify every label before
they can read one, which is more work than either convention saves.

**And four characters inside a label are markup, so a label about code has to
say so.** `_` subscripts the character after it, `^` raises it, `*a*` colours a
run with the accent and `~a~` greys it. That is what a figure full of `c_0` and
`m_1` wants. A marker that cannot do its job is drawn as typed: a `*` or a `~`
nothing closes, and a `_` or `^` in the middle of a word, where shifting one
character would leave the rest of the word behind – so `scan_page(link)` and
`hausarbeit_final.pdf` come out as written. What still shifts is a marker whose
one character ends the word, which is the case to watch in an identifier. Write
a backslash in front of any of the four – `\_`, `\^`, `\*`, `\~`, and `\\` for
a backslash – and the bare character is drawn instead.

```
# wrong: drawn as "MAX" with a subscript N
box lim "MAX_N" below coll

# right: one word, with the underscore in it
box lim "MAX\_N" below coll
```

It costs nothing: the escape is resolved before the label is measured, so the
box is the width of the word it draws. A backslash before anything else stays a
backslash, and `\n` is still where a label breaks its lines.

**A whole line in `~…~` is a second register.** In a label of more than one
line, a line written entirely in the quiet mark is set smaller and muted, so a
question over the verb that answers it is one label, centred as one block:
`text f "1  Who pays for it?\n~absorb~"`. Written as two `text` elements the
pair cannot be centred on the cell it labels, because each is centred on its
own. On a one-line label `~…~` stays the muted colour; `{.small}` is how a whole
label is made small.

The escape is the way out, not the plan. A figure whose boxes carry
`collect_links()` and `scan_page(link)` is usually a figure that should carry
`every link on that page` and `one visit per link` instead, and name the
functions in the prose beside it – rule 9. Reach for the backslash when the
identifier *is* the point: the one line of a listing the figure is about, a
constant the room has to recognise, a file name.

## 7. Run edges on axes, and bend them once

**Do:** keep edges horizontal or vertical. When one has to get around something,
give it one waypoint, not three. Let crossings happen at right angles.

**Why:** good continuation – the eye follows a line through a junction and gives
up at a corner. Each bend is a place a reader has to re-acquire the line.

The build helps: an edge more than a fraction off an axis but less than 4° off
is warned about, because that is almost never intent. Anything genuinely
diagonal is far outside the threshold.

```
# wrong: down, across, down again to dodge the Dec box
edge c0 -> x1 via c0.cx,0.7 1.4,0.7 1.4,1.9 x1.cx,1.9

# right: out sideways into the channel between the columns, then down
edge c0 -> x1 via c0.right+0.2,c0.cy c0.right+0.2,x1.cy
```

Note what the right-hand version does *not* do: it does not write coordinates.
Both waypoints are expressions over other elements, so the route survives the
figure being redrawn – and because the second one takes its height from the
target, the final approach is exactly horizontal by construction rather than by
arithmetic you would have to redo.

**The commonest bend of all is one word.** `.elbow` leaves on the axis the two
ends are furthest apart on, runs a rail across the gap, and turns in:
one turn out, one turn in, no waypoints written. It is what a tree's brackets
are made of, because the rail is measured between the two elements' facing
sides and not between their centres – so several children of one parent, sitting
on one level, all turn on the same line, and the set reads as one bracket rather
than as three separate connectors.

```
# wrong: the same two turns, written out once per child, against numbers that
# have to be redone the moment a rank moves
edge rt -- i1 via rt.cx,rt.bottom+0.75 i1.cx,rt.bottom+0.75 {.muted}
edge rt -- i2 via rt.cx,rt.bottom+0.75 i2.cx,rt.bottom+0.75 {.muted}

# right
edge rt -- i1 {.elbow .muted}
edge rt -- i2 {.elbow .muted}
```

It draws its own two waypoints, so `.elbow` together with `via` is an error
rather than a guess: use the class for the halfway rail and `via` to say where
the rail goes instead. And it is not routing – it looks at nothing else in the
figure, so an elbow can still run straight through a box that happens to be in
the way. That is rule 7's own problem, and `via` is the answer to it.

## 8. End an edge on an anchor, never inside a box

**Do:** name the side the arrow should arrive at – `b.left`, `b.top` – whenever
the automatic choice is wrong. Separate two edges between the same pair with a
fraction along the side.

**Why:** an arrowhead that crosses a border reads as a mistake in the drawing,
and it obscures both the border and itself. This is the "leave the edge clear"
rule: the arrow stops at the boundary and the boundary stays unbroken.

```
# wrong: two arrows on one line, and a head inside the box
edge eve -> bob "replay"
edge eve -> bob "forgery"

# right: the fraction slides the attachment along the side, so they run parallel
box  eve "Eve" at 0,0
box  bob "Bob" right of eve
edge eve.right:0.3 -> bob.left:0.3 "replay"  {.accent}
edge eve.right:0.7 -> bob.left:0.7 "forgery" {.accent}
```

A fraction is measured along each box's own side, so the same fraction of two
*different* heights lands at two different heights and the pair comes out very
slightly skewed. Boxes placed `right of` one another share one height, which is
what keeps the pair above level; the two ends of such a pair are not always
peers – one placed against a third box, one written `{.own}` – and there the
build says so by name, because it is one of the two things the 4°-off-axis
warning is written for. `same h as eve` is the fix.

**Being on the grid is not the same as being aligned**, which is worth saying
because it looks as though it ought to be. Two boxes both placed at whole grid
coordinates still have different centre lines the moment their heights differ,
and a line leaving the middle of a shape an odd number of units high cannot
land on a gridline at all. Alignment here comes from a row of peers, from
`same as`, from `align`, and from naming an anchor – never from the
coordinates being round numbers.

If an edge must pass *over* something on its way, put a `.paper` label at the
crossing, or reroute. Do not leave two lines fused at a junction.

## 9. Draw the fewest things that carry the argument

**Do:** cut anything that is not doing work. A server does not need drive bays,
a compromised host does not need a biohazard symbol, a person does not need a
face unless the figure is about people.

**Why:** Prägnanz – vision settles on the simplest reading available. Every mark
you add is a mark someone has to rule out. Tufte's name for the same rule is the
data-ink ratio: take out the non-data ink and the redundant data ink, within
reason, and what is left is the drawing.

Before you add an element, ask which beat it belongs to. If the answer is "none",
it is decoration.

## 10. No shadows, no free colours, no rotation for effect

**Do:** stay inside the closed vocabulary.

**Why:** the four tones are mixed from `--emph` and `--ink` over `--paper`, so
they survive all seven themes including the two phosphor modes. Because they
are one hue at four strengths rather than four hues, they also survive a
monochrome printer, which four picked colours do not – red and green at the
same brightness come out as one grey. A fixed hue imported from a slide deck
works on exactly one background. And a shadow is a depth cue in a drawing that
has no depth: it adds a second edge to every shape and buys nothing. There is
none in the vocabulary.

`.turn` is for a label that has no room to be horizontal – a firewall bar, a
matrix row, an axis title. It is not a way to make a figure look busy.

## 11. Size is a claim, so make every size deliberate

**Do:** nothing, for a row – the engine gives a run of `right of` boxes one
size. Reach for a written size, or for `{.own}`, only where the thing in the
bigger box really does contain or control the smaller ones.

**Why:** relative size reads as importance (Carter). A box half again as wide as
its neighbours is taken to be the important one before anyone has worked out
why, and the usual reason it is wider is that its label happened to have more
letters in it. That is the drawing making an argument the author never made.
This rule is the one the engine took over: it is a default now, so the wrong
picture is the one that costs a word.

```
# wrong: three peers, and the middle one is twice the size of the others
# because "Correlation engine" is twice as long a phrase. It takes a `.own`
# per box to write it at all now – keep the shape in mind for a drawing you
# did not make.
box a "Sensor" at 0,0 {.tone-1 .own}
box b "Correlation engine" right of a gap 0.4 {.tone-1 .own}
box c "Log" right of b gap 0.4 {.tone-1 .own}

# right: say nothing, and break the long label where the phrase divides
box a "Sensor" at 0,0 {.tone-1}
box b "Correlation\nengine" right of a gap 0.4 {.tone-1}
box c "Log" right of b gap 0.4 {.tone-1}
```

The `\n` is the whole remaining fix. There is no automatic line breaking, so the
break is a decision, and putting it where the phrase divides reads better than
any measure the build could take – and the row's three boxes then take the
two-line height together, because they are peers. `.shrink` is the other answer
where the box may not grow – but type size is a size claim too, and a room reads
small type as less important.

**Down a column the engine shares the width and not the height**, because a
stack of bands is as often a record – a header, three fields, a signature – as
it is a row on its side, and each band's height is what stands in it. Where a
column really is a set of peers, `col a, b, c` says so in one line and shares
both. `row a, b, c gap 0.8` is the same statement across, and it places what it
names, so a row of peers is one line rather than one `same as` and one `gap` per
box. Both are also the answer when a box stands in a row *and* a column and so
comes out wider than its own row: a statement levels its members against
everything else they stand in, where the implicit rule cannot. Where only one
axis is shared – a one-line box that wants its neighbour's height and its own
width – it is `same h as` / `same w as`.

### And the slide has a size claim of its own

**A figure is drawn on a fixed canvas, and the canvas is the same on every
slide of the deck.** On a `.wide` chunk it is **36 base labels across and 16
down**; `.full` gives 44 across, `.standard` 26, `.narrow` 20. That is what
fits at the size of the words beside it, and it is not many: a base label is
one em, so 36 across is four or five boxes in a row with their gaps. The build
prints both numbers, and the miss in labels and in px, when a drawing misses
the box in either direction.

Two failures, and each has its own fix:

- **Wider or taller than the canvas.** The drawing is scaled down to fit the
  slide, so the labels come out smaller than the prose and the slide's whole
  type follows them down – which the room reads as a heading that changes size
  between consecutive slides. The fix is nearly always **one row too long**:
  fewer columns of content, shorter labels, a `\n` in the long one, a second
  figure on a second slide. Going wider does not help – `.wide` is already at
  the frame – and stacking what was in a row buys width only until the height
  reserve takes it back.
- **Less than half the canvas used.** The slide stands mostly empty, and on a
  chunk with prose under the drawing the reserve pushes the words down and
  auto-fit shrinks them to make room for paper. Either the figure has more to
  say than it is saying, or it is a specimen rather than a slide – and a
  specimen writes `frame WxH` to reserve what it draws.

A deck that is a catalogue of drawings rather than a talk turns the whole thing
off with `frame none` in its `draw-defaults`. A deck whose figures are slides
should not.

## 12. Lay the figure out the way the room reads it

**Do:** start at the top left and run left to right, top to bottom. The first
thing in time or in cause goes at the top left, the last at the bottom right.

**Why:** with nothing shouting for attention, a reader works through a figure
the way they work through a page of text (Carter): top left, then a zig-zag
rightwards and down. A figure whose flow runs against that gets read twice, once
the wrong way and again after the arrowheads have been noticed.

```
# wrong: the packet starts on the right and travels left
box out "Internet" at 0,0 {.tone-1}
box fw  "Firewall" left of out gap 0.8 {.tone-1}
box cl  "Client"   left of fw gap 0.8 {.tone-2}
edge out -> fw
edge fw -> cl

# right
box cl  "Client"   at 0,0 {.tone-2}
box fw  "Firewall" right of cl gap 0.8 {.tone-1}
box out "Internet" right of fw gap 0.8 {.tone-1}
edge cl -> fw
edge fw -> out
```

The exception is a figure whose subject is the *return*: a request out and a
response back is two directions on purpose, and the pair reads correctly
because the outward leg is the upper one. What does not survive is a single
chain laid out backwards. This is also what lets a swimlane carry time with no
axis drawn and a flowchart say which branch is the default with no word spent
on it: in both, the reading order is the argument.

## 13. `.bold` marks one element, never a category

**Do:** say what *kind* of thing an element is with a tone, an outline or a
shape, and keep `.bold` for the one element the figure is about.

**Why:** bold has no degrees (Carter). Bold on every system box says "these are
the systems" and at the same time says "look here" about all of them, which is
the same as saying it about none. `.bold`
also belongs to no class slot, so nothing displaces it: a `default box {.bold}`
boldens every box in the block, and the only way out of it is to take the class
off by name, `{!bold}` on the element's own line. Unlike two tones from one
slot, which the build refuses outright, nothing complains about the result.

```
# wrong: bold as a category marker – every box shouts, so none does
box cl "Client" at 0,0 {.tone-2 .bold}
box sv "Server" right of cl gap 1.6 {.tone-2 .bold}
box ca "CA"     above sv gap 0.7 {.tone-2 .bold}
edge cl -> sv "ClientHello" {.paper .small}

# right: the tone carries the category, the bold carries the emphasis
box cl "Client" at 0,0 {.tone-2}
box sv "Server" right of cl gap 1.6 {.tone-1 .bold}
box ca "CA"     above sv gap 0.7 {.tone-1}
edge cl -> sv "ClientHello" {.paper .small}
```

`.bold` and `emph` are not interchangeable, and *where* you write a prominence
class decides what the handout shows: a prominence class on an element's own
line is part of the drawing and appears in the handout, while one a `step` sets
is a lecture-time act and does not. `.bold` prints either way. Bold the element
the whole figure is about; `emph` the element this beat is about.

## 14. A leader is short, straight, and parallel to its neighbours

**Do:** put an outside label beside the thing it names, on the side where there
is room, and run the words towards the object: `.right` on a label sitting to
the left of its subject, `.left` on one sitting to the right.

**Why:** Carter's rules for outside labels are all one idea – a leader is
plumbing, and it must not be read as content. Keep the line as short as the
layout allows, keep several of them parallel, and never let two cross: a
crossing is read as a relationship, which is the claim rule 3 says an arrow
makes.

```
# wrong: two long leaders that cross, and neither label is anywhere near
# what it names
box  sw "Switch" at 0,0 h 1.2 w 1.2 {.tone-1}
box  rt "Router" right of sw gap 1.6 h 1.2 w 1.2 {.tone-1}
text n1 "learns MAC\naddresses" above rt gap 0.9 -- sw {.small .muted}
text n2 "forwards by\nprefix" above sw gap 0.9 -- rt {.small .muted}

# right: each label outside the pair, a short stub, and the words run
# towards the box they belong to
box  sw "Switch" at 0,0 h 1.2 w 1.2 {.tone-1}
box  rt "Router" right of sw gap 1.6 h 1.2 w 1.2 {.tone-1}
text n1 "learns MAC\naddresses" left of sw gap 0.5 -- sw {.small .muted .right}
text n2 "forwards by\nprefix" right of rt gap 0.5 -- rt {.small .muted .left}
```

**Two of Carter's rules for outside labels are already the default here, and it
is worth knowing which.** The stub a `text … -- ref` grows is drawn thin and
grey, and it carries no waypoints, so it is a single straight segment by
construction. The token means here what it means on an edge: `--` is the plain
stub and is what almost every leader wants, `->` is a leader that *points*.
Reach for `->` sparingly – a leader with an arrowhead is hard to tell from an
`edge` in a busy figure, which is the claim rule 3 says an arrow makes. `<-`
and `<->` are refused, because a leader names one operand and the words are
always the other end. What is left to the author is the pair the grammar cannot
decide for them – which side, and how short – plus the alignment, which is what
`.left` and `.right` are for. On a label of more than one line they put the
words flush against the edge nearest the object, which is what Carter's
flush-right rule asks for.

**This is also how a figure that shows a procedure carries its explanation.** A
figure about structure works with few labels; one that shows a procedure needs
sentences, and they belong at the place they describe rather than in the prose
under the figure. It is rule 1 again: a reader who has to look away and come
back rebuilds the picture each time.

## 15. Take the outline off and the fill has to do its work

**Do:** if you write `.bare`, give the shape a fill dark enough to be a shape
on its own – `.tone-3` rather than `.tone-1`. And keep the count down. Several
`.bare` shapes in the strongest fill read as a figure in which everything is
emphasised at once.

**Why:** the outline is what closes the contour, and a closed contour is what
the eye takes for an object. Dropping it is a legitimate way to cut clutter and
it moves the whole job onto the fill, which then has to be darker than it would
otherwise have been (Carter). Past three or four such shapes the saving has
been spent and the figure has no quiet ground left to emphasise anything
against.

```
# wrong: one fill too pale to be a shape at all, three too loud to be
# anything but the point, and a reversed label at .small
box a "Collector"   at 0,0 w 1.3 {.bare .tone-1}
box b "Store"       right of a gap 0.4 {.bare .tone-4}
box c "Correlator"  right of b gap 0.4 {.bare .tone-4}
box d "alerts only" right of c gap 0.4 {.bare .tone-4 .small}

# right: one tone for the set, the solid fill spent on the one element
# worth spending it on, and its label at full size
box a "Collector"   at 0,0 w 1.3 {.bare .tone-3}
box b "Store"       right of a gap 0.4 {.bare .tone-3}
box c "Correlator"  right of b gap 0.4 {.bare .tone-3}
box d "alerts only" right of c gap 0.4 {.tone-4}
```

**The exception is a region rather than an object.** A `container` written
`.bare` with a pale fill is a ground, and a ground is supposed to recede – it
is the other half of rule 4's note about strong colour on large areas, and
`#motion` in `lectures/diagrams` is what it looks like done right. The rule
above is about shapes that have to read as *things*.

**`.tone-4` with `.small` is the specific pair to watch.** `.tone-4` turns its
own label the colour of the paper, so that it can be read on a solid fill, and
`.small` is 12px: reversed type at 12px is legible on the machine that drew the
figure and gone from the back of a lecture theatre. A solid-filled box that needs a small label needs a shorter label
instead.

---

## Five arrangements a lecture keeps asking for

Most lecture figures are one of five shapes. Four of them have a statement or a
class that writes them outright, and each of the five turns on one construction
fact that is not obvious from the grammar.

**A flowchart** runs its main road straight down and lets every branch leave
sideways, so a reader who follows the vertical line is following the case that
goes through. The decision is a `.diamond`: the one outline a room has been
trained to read since school. Keep its label to two or three words. A diamond
offers its text only a strip through the middle, so the build sizes it at
**twice** what a rectangle would need for the same string – a sentence in a
diamond arrives at four times the area of the boxes around it and takes the
figure over.

```
# wrong: a sentence in a diamond, dwarfing every box in the column
box d1 "Is this flow already known to the state table?" below in gap 0.55 {.diamond .tone-1}

# right: the question in the diamond, the detail in a note beside it
box  d1 "Known flow?" below in gap 0.55 {.diamond .tone-1}
text n1 "state table, per five-tuple" right of d1 gap 0.5 -- d1 {.small .muted}
```

**A swimlane** is `lanes`: equal bands, `.turn`ed captions outside the left
edge, contents placed against a band's own centre (`swim-1.cy`) with the
left-to-right order carrying the time. Ask before writing one whether the figure
shows *steps parcelled out to the people responsible for them* or *messages
passing between them*. If it is the second it is a `sequence`, where who runs
across the top and time runs down the page. Do not build a
swimlane out of `container`s – a container fits its members, so bands holding
different numbers of things come out ragged at both ends, which is the opposite
of what a swimlane means. Every hand-off crosses a band, which is what `.elbow`
is for: a straight line from one band to the next reads as a diagonal through a
band it never enters.

```
# right: three bands, and nothing has to say what the time axis is
lanes swim "User | SOC | IT ops" at 0,0 w 7.4 band 0.95 {.muted .dashed}
box  rep "Reports\nsuspect mail" at swim.left+0.85,swim-0.cy w 1.5 {.tone-2}
box  tri "Triage"                at swim.left+2.5,swim-1.cy  w 1.1 {.tone-1}
edge rep -> tri {.elbow}
```

**A tree is built leaf-first.** The leaves are the fixed points – they are what
the figure is actually about – and each parent is then placed `between` its own
two children with an upward `offset`. Move a leaf and every rank above it
re-centres with no other line touched.

```
# wrong: root first, then "centre it over the children" with align. align hands
# the FIRST element's coordinate to the rest, so this does not centre the root
# over its children – it stacks both children on the root's own centre line
box   rt "Root CA"      at 0,0
box   i1 "Issuing CA A" below rt gap 1.5
box   i2 "Issuing CA B" right of i1 gap 0.8 same as i1
align x middle rt, i1, i2

# right: leaves first, and every parent is the midpoint of what it signs
box  l1 "www.example.org"  at 0,0 w 1.5
box  l2 "mail.example.org" right of l1 gap 0.2
box  i1 "Issuing CA A" between l1,l2 offset 0,-1.5 w 1.5
edge i1 -- l1 {.elbow .muted}
edge i1 -- l2 {.elbow .muted}
```

**A table** is `table`: the heading row as one quoted string split on `|`, the
body rows as bare quoted strings on the lines directly under it, `col` giving
one width per column and `row` the height of **one** row. (`w` is the frame
instead – the total, shared out equally – and writing both is refused, because
they are one number said twice.) The per-row word is deliberate: on a box or a
chart `h` is how tall the thing is, and reading it that way on a `table` is
wrong by a factor of the row count. `lanes` spells the same idea `band` and
`sequence` spells it `header`. Every cell arrives carrying a tag
for its row and a tag for its column – `@t-row-2`, `@t-col-1` – so lighting a
row per beat is one line of source rather than one cell name per column, kept in
step with the table by hand.

Four more things a table says in a word. A table of pairs – a key and its
value, a term and its gloss – has no heading row, and `unheaded` on the line
says so. A second table stacked under the first so their columns line up takes
them with `same as <table>` rather than a second `col` list nobody knows to keep
equal. A column ranged differently from the rest is `default box @t-col-0
{.left}` above the table: `{.left}` on the table line lands on every cell, and
no word takes it off one column again. And `{.large}` on the table grows the
row height with the type, so no `row` has to be worked out for it.

**Rows are entities and columns are properties, and the order of the rows is an
argument.** Readers expect that shape and scan a column downwards looking for
the exception, so the transposed version – properties down the side, entities
across the top – is harder to read and buys nothing (Carter). Ordering the rows
on one column's *value* rather than on their names makes that column the one the
table is about, which is either the point or a claim you did not mean to make;
alphabetical is the fallback for when no order says anything. The same holds
for a chart: a run of bars sorted by length reads as a ranking with no word
spent on saying so, and `horizontal` below is what makes the sorted form
legible.

**And a table's last beat is what print gets.** A figure that lights each row in
turn and stops prints with its final row still lit, which reports a moment in
the talk rather than the table. If the finished picture wants no highlight – or
wants a different one, a tinted answer column, say – that is one more beat, and
a figure without it is one beat short.

```
# wrong: the last row is lit when the lecture ends, so it is lit on the handout
step at-the-application
  style @t-row-4 {.tone-4}

# right: one more beat, ending on the picture worth printing
step at-the-application
  style @t-row-4 {.tone-4}
step every-one-of-them-has-an-answer
  style @t-row-4 {.clear}
  style @t-col-2 {.tone-2}
```

**Where you wrote it decides what the handout shows, not which word you used.**
A prominence class on an element's own line is part of the drawing and appears
in the handout; a prominence a *step* sets is a lecture-time act and does not.
`emph a` and `style a {.emph}` are the same act, so the seam is the line, not
the verb. A tone is different again: `style` is the only way to set one per
beat, and print keeps the last beat's tone – which is why a tinted row needs
the beat that takes it off again, while a row the room is only meant to look at
for a moment can be an `emph` inside a step and needs no closing beat.

**A protocol** is `sequence`: who is across the top, one lifeline per actor, and
time *is* the vertical axis. That is the half of the pair `lanes` does not
cover, where who runs down the side and time is only the reading direction.
**It owns the vertical rhythm and nothing else**: it stacks a band per entry,
each as tall as what stands in it, so a note pushes the messages under it down
instead of cutting into their labels. Everything else it answers by giving every
part it draws a name you can write. Every head keeps the name its `actor` line
gives it, every lifeline is `<actor>-life`, every message is `<seq>-N` counting
from 0, and the tags `@<seq>-msg-N`, `@<seq>-msgs`, `@<actor>-msgs`,
`@<seq>-notes` name the sets. So the annotation a real protocol slide always
ends up needing is an ordinary line of source hung off an ordinary name. One
ordering rule comes with that: the entry run reads *through* blank lines and
ends at the first line that is not an entry, so an annotation carrying an arrow
token – a `text … -- x` leader – must not be the first line under the entries,
or it is read as one more message. Put the `brace` or the `container` first,
which is where it usually wants to be anyway; a line with no arrow token in it
closes the run.

```
# wrong: a note the sequence cannot see, positioned by hand against a coordinate
#        that moves the moment a message is inserted above it
text n "die Challenge ist die Frische" at 4.2,2.6 {.small}

# right: hung off the message it is about, and it follows when the figure moves
brace ctap over wa-3,wa-4,wa-5 pad 0.3 "auf dem Gerät, über CTAP" side left {.small .turn}
text n "die Challenge ist die Frische" right of wa-2 gap 1.9 {.small .hand} -- wa-2
```

Three things a protocol figure gets wrong often enough to name. **A response is
`{.dashed}`, not a second kind of arrow** – a message *is* an edge, so it takes
the edge's four arrow tokens (`->`, `<-`, `--`, `<->`) and the edge's classes,
and dashed against solid is the distinction the room already reads. **A local action is a self-message or a note, and the two are not
interchangeable**: `au -> au "sign"` is one step in the sequence and takes a
number, a `note au "…"` is a standing fact about that lifeline and takes none.
**Payload detail belongs in a message's second string, not in a note under it** –
the second string is set smaller under the arrow and moves with it, where a note
is a band of its own and pushes the whole figure taller for something that is a
footnote to one line. The two strings have fixed roles and no word swaps them:
the first is the message's **name** and goes over the arrow, the second is its
**payload** and goes under it. If what you have written wants to be the other
way round, it is usually two messages. A brace's label goes `.turn`ed when the
brace stands on the left – `side left` on the `brace` line – or it runs back
over the number column.

**Break a long protocol into phases with `space` on the entry that opens one.**
`space 0.9` on a message or a note is the air above *that* band, and two or
three of them turn fifteen undifferentiated rows into three groups a room can
hold. A blank line in the source does nothing to the drawing: the statement
reads straight through it, so the lines stay free to be grouped for whoever
reads the source.

```
# wrong: fifteen messages at one rhythm, and the room has nowhere to rest
sequence s at 0,0
  actor rp "RP"
  actor u  "User"
  actor br "Browser"
  rp -> br "session cookie"
  u  -> br "later: click 'Sign in'"

# right: the second phase is announced by the paper around it
sequence s at 0,0
  actor rp "RP"
  actor u  "User"
  actor br "Browser"
  rp -> br "session cookie"
  u  -> br "later: click 'Sign in'" space 0.9
```

---

## Charts: six decisions the grammar will not make for you

**Say what shape the chart is with `aspect`, not with `w` and `h`.** Those two
are counts of *grid cells*, and a grid cell is not square: on a `150x52` grid a
plot written `w 1.9 h 1.5` arrives 285 pixels by 78, which is very wide and
very flat and looks nothing like the two numbers that produced it. It is the one
place where the coordinate grid shows through into a decision about the picture,
and it catches everybody once.

```
# wrong: two numbers that look like a shape and are not
plot roc "False positive rate" "True positive rate" at 0,0 w 1.9 h 1.5 x 0,1 y 0,1 tick 0.2

# right: the proportion the room sees, and the build works the rest out
plot roc "False positive rate" "True positive rate" at 0,0 w 1.6 aspect 1:1 x 0,1 y 0,1 tick 0.2
```

A ROC curve is square because both axes are the same quantity and the diagonal
has to read as 45°. A trend over time is usually wider than tall. A comparison
of a handful of magnitudes is often neither, because it should not be a plot at
all. Write `aspect 4:3`, `aspect 1:1`, or one bare number meaning that many wide
to one tall. Writing `w`, `h` and `aspect` together is an error: two ways of
stating one number is two ways of stating different ones.

**A row of charts meant to be compared takes its size from the first of them.**
`same as <chart>` on a `plot` or a `bars` copies the whole frame, so the frames
match to the pixel. Three that differ by a hair cannot be read against one
another, which is what a row of charts is for.

```
# right: one frame stated once, and the rest said in two words each
plot roc  "False positive rate" "True positive rate" at 0,0 w 1.6 aspect 1:1 x 0,1 y 0,1 tick 0.25
plot roc2 "False positive rate" "True positive rate" right of roc gap 0.7 same as roc x 0,1 y 0,1 tick 0.25
```

The chart being copied has to be written **above** the one copying it. A chart is
sized as its own line is read, because that is when its gridlines, its ticks and
its columns are placed, so it can only copy one it has already seen. Rather than
draw a frame of the wrong size, the build names which of three things went wrong:
the chart named is declared below, the name belongs to something that is not a
chart, or there is no such name in the block. `same as` beside `w`, `h` or
`aspect` is refused as well, because the size would then be stated twice, and so
is `same as` on a `series of` line: a series draws in the frame of the chart it
joined and has no frame of its own to size.

**Turn a bar chart sideways when the labels are phrases, or when the point is a
ranking.** A reader ranks lengths from a shared left edge more reliably than
heights from a shared floor, so `horizontal` on a `bars` line is not one more
way of drawing the same picture: it is usually the better one. And a category
called "DNS cache poisoning" cannot be written under an upright column at all –
it cannot be written there at all. The upright label list is split on spaces,
one word per column, so a phrase has to be cut down to an abbreviation the room
decodes from a legend – which is a legend nobody reads at the back.

```
# wrong: four abbreviations, because a space-split list has no room for a phrase
bars t "20,19,17,12" "ARP SYN DNS TLS" at 0,0 w 2.2 h 0.9

# right: sideways, and the category names split on a pipe so a label may be a phrase
bars t "20,19,17,12" "ARP spoofing | SYN flood | DNS cache poisoning | TLS stripping" at 0,0 w 2.2 h 1.4 horizontal
```

The quoted list of category names is split on `|` whenever it contains one, and
on spaces otherwise – the same mark that separates a `table` row and a `lanes`
name. Everything else about the chart is unchanged: a second `series of` still
groups or stacks, a `brace` still spans three bars, `emph 2` still marks the
third one from the opening beat, and the names are still `t-0`, `t-1`, `t-2`.
Only two things move: the strip of category labels, to a right-aligned column
down the left margin, and the baseline, which stands up on the left.

Keep the upright form for a distribution, a time series, or anything where the
categories are short and ordered – a run of columns left to right reads as a
sequence, which is exactly what a sideways chart cannot say.

**Three overlapping lines is the limit, and the way past it is more frames, not
more tones.** Four curves in one plot is a knot: every crossing is a place the
eye has to pick its line up again, and the fifth tone does not exist anyway.
Draw one frame per comparison and put the *same* series in every one, `.muted`,
as the baseline (Carter). Each curve is then compared against something that
does not move, and the frames can be read in either order.

```
# wrong: four curves, a dozen crossings, and the reader ranking tones
plot p "week" "alerts" at 0,0 w 2.0 aspect 4:3 x 0,8 y 0,8 tick 2
edge p@0,p@2   -- p@8,p@7   via p@2,p@3   p@4,p@4.4 p@6,p@6   {.smooth .muted .thick}
edge p@0,p@3.5 -- p@8,p@3   via p@2,p@6.2 p@4,p@2   p@6,p@5.5 {.smooth .accent}
edge p@0,p@6   -- p@8,p@5.2 via p@2,p@4   p@4,p@7.5 p@6,p@3.6 {.smooth .tone-3}
edge p@0,p@1   -- p@8,p@7.6 via p@2,p@7   p@4,p@2.5 p@6,p@6.8 {.smooth .tone-1}

```

Two frames side by side have to carry the same `x` and `y` domains, or the
comparison the arrangement promises is a lie. Nothing in the build checks that,
and it is the one thing to re-read before the figure ships.

**Name a curve at the curve.** A `text … -- ref` beside the end of a line costs
one statement and puts the name where the eye already is; a key in the corner
asks a reader to hold a tone in memory, look away, and come back (Carter). A
legend is the right answer only where the names cannot go beside the marks at
all – a `bars` chart with two or three `series of`, where the marks are
interleaved columns – and there the chart draws it: `key "scanner"` on a
`bars` line, the frame's and each series', puts a swatch and the name in a row
above the frame, as `#sp8` in `docs/artifact/figure-rules` shows. The swatch is
a column of the run, so it has the run's colour by construction; a legend built
by hand out of boxes shows a tone at a box's strength, which is not what the
columns are filled with.

**A histogram is a `bars` with `space 0`, and the space is the whole
difference.** A bar chart compares categories, which are separate things, so
its columns stand apart. A histogram shows a distribution over one continuous
axis, and its bins are adjacent stretches of that axis, so its columns touch.
Each drawn the other way round says something false about its own data: a
histogram with gaps claims its bins are unrelated categories, and a bar chart
without them claims its categories are a continuum.

```
# right: a distribution, and the bins are adjacent, so the columns are too
bars h "2,5,11,19,24,18,9,4,2" "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8" at 0,0 w 2.4 aspect 3:1 space 0 {.tone-3}

# right: four categories, which are separate things, and the gaps say so
bars b "24,19,11,5" "A B C D" at 0,0 w 2.4 aspect 3:1 {.tone-3}
```

Give a histogram at least five bins; fewer is a shape with no distribution in
it. And three of Carter's bar-chart rules are already the default here, which
is worth knowing so you do not spend a line restating them. A `bars` column is
measured up from zero, and a value below zero is refused by name – so the
truncated axis that turns a small difference into an enormous one is not
writable. The default `space` is a quarter of the cell, which puts the gap at
about a third of the bar width. And a `series of` shares its cell with the
columns beside it, so grouped bars touch inside a group and the gap falls
between groups, which is Carter's rule for grouped data without your having to
space anything by hand.

**A column has no outline, and `emph` on one is a fill.** A box closes its
contour with a stroke; a column does not need one, because its neighbours and
the baseline already say where it ends, and an outline on a column is ink
that encodes nothing (Tufte). So a `bars` line draws its columns `.bare`, and
`emph 2` turns column 2 solid accent, which is what `.tone-4` means, instead
of drawing a 2.6 accent outline across a 1.05 baseline. `.thick` puts an
outline back, for the one chart that wants one.

**A column reads its tone at a column's strength, not a box's.** A tone on a
box is mixed pale so the ink of its label stays legible on it; a column has no
label, and the same mix is a watermark on a projector, worst in the dark
themes. So the columns are filled darker – a column with no tone at all is a
mid grey, `.tone-2` a lighter grey, `.tone-3` a darker one, `.tone-1` a strong
accent tint and `.tone-4` the accent – in the same hues and the same order as
the box tones. Write a tone only where it is a category, one per `series of`,
so the runs can be told apart; a single run needs none.

**The linter measures the columns against the paper in all seven themes** and
warns where a fill falls under 3:1, WCAG's floor for graphics, naming the
themes. `.tone-1` misses it where the accent is a light hue (teal, orange),
`.tone-2` in the two terminal themes, whose ink and paper are close to begin
with. That is information, not a refusal: ignore it for a theme you will not
present in.

**In a grouped chart, single a group out with `dim`, not with `emph`.** A
column has one channel, its fill, and in a chart with two runs the fill already
says which run a column belongs to. `emph 3` on both lines paints both Q4
columns in the accent, and the years are gone at exactly the quarter the
figure is about; `emph` on a `.tone-4` run changes nothing at all. The linter
warns on both. `dim 0,1,2` on every line says the same thing and keeps the
runs apart.

```
# right: one run, no tone, the accent for the one column that matters
bars b "24,19,11,5" "A B C D" at 0,0 w 2.4 aspect 3:1 emph 0

# right: two runs, two tones, a legend the chart draws, and Q4 singled
# out by dimming the rest
bars y1 "24,19,11,5" "A B C D" at 0,0 w 2.4 aspect 3:1 dim 0,1,2 key "2023" {.tone-3}
bars y2 "20,22,9,7" series of y1 dim 0,1,2 key "2024" {.tone-4}

# wrong: both runs lit at Q4 come out in one colour there
bars y1 "24,19,11,5" "A B C D" at 0,0 w 2.4 aspect 3:1 emph 3 {.tone-3}
bars y2 "20,22,9,7" series of y1 emph 3 {.tone-4}
```

## Steps: four beats, in this order

A figure with steps is an argument, not a slideshow. The order that works
almost every time:

1. **The stage.** Everything that is just true: the topology, the axes, the
   participants. One beat, no emphasis.
2. **The normal case.** What happens when nothing is wrong. This is what the
   attack will be measured against.
3. **The disturbance.** The attacker, the failure, the exception. This is the
   beat that earns `.accent` and `emph`.
4. **The consequence.** The defence, the result, the number. Often `dim` on
   what came before, so the last beat is not four things shouting at once.

Rules that go with it:

- **Print is the last beat, and its prominence is the opening beat's.** Not the
  union of all beats. So the last beat has to be a picture that makes sense on
  paper, standing alone; if it is not, you have one beat too few. And the seam
  between what prints and what does not is the *line*, not the word: a
  prominence class on an element's own line is part of the drawing and reaches
  the handout, a prominence a `step` sets does not. So an element written
  `{.dim}` because it is background stays grey on paper, and `dim x` inside
  beat 3 does not. To go back to normal for one stretch of a stepped figure,
  take the class off by name: `style x {!dim}`.
- **Backwards costs nothing.** Every beat is recomputed from the counter, so
  you can step back and forth freely and `hide` is as usable as `show`.
- **Do not put a `show` on every element.** See rule 5. Over-specified steps are
  where figures rot: someone adds an element, forgets the step, and it never
  appears.
- **An element starts hidden only if the first thing any step says about it is
  `show`.** So a thing that is on screen at the start and taken away later needs
  no special handling.
- **Emphasis a figure opens with belongs on the statement, not in step 1.**
  On a chart that means the `bars` line itself: `bars port "12,9,41,7,5" … emph 2 dim 0,1,3,4`
  says which column the sentence beside the figure is about from the moment the
  slide appears. Written as a step instead, the picture the room first sees is
  five equal columns and the point only exists once you have pressed Space.
  This is also the print rule seen from the other side: emphasis on the
  statement is emphasis the handout keeps.

## Before a figure is finished

Work down this list. It is written so it can be checked mechanically.

1. `node lint.js <source.md>` is clean. No warnings talked past.
2. `node build.js <source.md>` prints no `[diagram]` warning, or the source
   carries a comment saying why the remaining one is deliberate.
2a. In particular, no `figure-overflows-canvas` and no
   `figure-underfills-canvas`: the first is a drawing too big for the slide it
   is on and the second is a slide standing empty, and both are told in labels
   and in px with the `frame WxH` that would reserve what this drawing actually
   draws. Rule 11 is where they are explained.
2b. No overlap warning talked past either. The check measures ink – a label
   line by line – so one that fires is a stroke really crossing words, and the
   fix is the drawing. No `edge-short` either: every arrow has a shaft as well
   as a head, which a gap nobody wrote always leaves.
3. No edge runs at a slight angle. (The build says so; do not silence it by
   nudging – align the elements.)
4. Every label that overlaps a line or a fill has a fill class of its own.
5. Every arrowhead lands on a border, none inside a box, none two-on-a-line.
6. No tone carries two meanings in one figure, and none contradicts the table
   in rule 4.
7. Each beat is one idea. Read the step names out loud in order: they should
   sound like an argument.
8. The last beat is a sensible handout picture on its own. A figure that lights
   one row, one column or one box at a time ends on a beat that puts the
   highlight where the handout should have it, or takes it off.
9. Every edge label in the figure follows one convention: on the line for a
   token that names the line, beside it for a phrase that describes what runs
   along it. Never both in one figure. And every one of them fits: the build
   reports a label wider than the paper between the two elements it joins,
   which is a word arriving in the room with both ends missing.
10. Every `.diamond` holds two or three words. It is sized at twice what a
    rectangle would need, so a sentence in one is a shape four times the area of
    its neighbours.
11. Nothing is hand-built that a statement writes: a grid of labelled cells is
    `table`, equal bands with names down the side are `lanes`, messages between
    lifelines down the page are `sequence`, columns whose heights are numbers
    are `bars`, and one turn out and one turn in is `.elbow`. Twelve hand-named
    boxes are twelve things to keep in step.
12. Every chart says its shape with `aspect`, not with `w` and `h`. A grid cell
    is not square, so those two do not describe the proportion anyone sees. A
    row of charts meant to be read against one another takes its frame from the
    first of them, with `same as`.
13. Every bar chart whose categories are phrases, or whose point is a ranking,
    runs `horizontal`. Four words under four upright columns are four words
    nobody in the room reads.
14. Opened in the browser, cycled through all seven themes with `A`: nothing
    disappears, nothing goes unreadable. The two phosphor modes are the strict
    ones.
15. `node test/run.mjs framing` passes. It measures the slack on all four sides
    of every figure and is the only check that catches a picture which is
    correct but not centred in its own frame.
16. The figure is a figure at all: structure – what holds what, what connects
    to what, what is the same as what – rather than a procedure that would read
    better as prose, as a listing, or as a `::: script` block.
17. Nothing is a different size by accident. A row or a column of peers is
    one size because the build makes it so; every `{.own}`, every written
    size and every size difference left standing is a claim about importance
    the figure means to make.
18. The flow runs left to right and top to bottom, unless the figure's subject
    is a return leg.
19. `.bold` is on at most one element. No leader crosses another, and no `.bare`
    *box* carries a fill paler than `.tone-3` (a `.bare` container is a ground
    and is exempt).
20. Every `_`, `^`, `*` and `~` in a label is meant. Inside a word the first
    two are drawn as typed, but one whose single character ends the word still
    shifts it, so `MAX_N` draws a subscript N and nothing reports it. Write
    `\_` for the literal, and read every label carrying code once with that in
    mind.
21. No plot holds more than three overlapping lines; a fourth is a second frame
    carrying the same `.muted` baseline. Every histogram is `space 0`, and no
    bar chart is.
22. The last beat of every figure has been read at full size, in the frames
    `node build.js <source.md> --frames` writes. A contact sheet finds the
    slide; it is too small to show a line struck through by an outline.

## What this grammar cannot do

Knowing the walls saves the time spent walking into them.

- **No free colours.** Four tones, plus `.accent` and `.muted`. If you need a
  fifth distinction, use shape (`.hex`, `.diamond`, `.chevron`, `.wedge`,
  `.cross`, the pointed ones aimed with `point`) or family (`.mono`,
  `.serif`) instead – and ask first whether the figure is doing too much.
- **No automatic routing.** Edges are straight segments through the waypoints
  you write. Nothing steps around a box for you, and nothing fans out parallel
  edges – that is what the `:0.3` / `:0.7` fractions are for. The single
  coordinate the engine will invent for you is `.elbow`'s rail, and you have no
  option to move it: it sits halfway across the gap, unless halfway would leave
  too little run after it for the arrowhead to read, in which case it sits
  nearer the source. Where the gap is too small for even that, the build says
  so and the number to change is the gap.
- **No automatic line breaking.** A label breaks where you write `\n`, and
  nowhere else.
- **No shadows and no gradients.** Drawing order is fixed too – zones,
  containers, images, braces, edges, then boxes, dots and texts – with one way
  out:
  `.front` on an edge moves it in front of the boxes. That is right for an
  axis and wrong for an arrow, which should be covered by the box it arrives
  at, so it is opt-in.
- **No arbitrary rotation.** `.turn` turns a label 90°, and `point` aims a
  chevron or a wedge at one of the four compass directions. Nothing rotates to
  an arbitrary angle.
- **No cylinder, no cloud, no polygon of your own.** The outlines are the
  rectangle, the circle, the hexagon, the diamond, the chevron, the wedge and
  the cross – the chevron and the wedge aimed with `point`. A database is a
  `.round` box in the tone you gave storage; a cloud is a box labelled
  `Internet`. If a shape genuinely carries meaning of its own, draw it as an
  SVG file and place it with `image`.
- **Text width is estimated, not measured.** There is no browser at build time,
  so the estimate is tuned slightly generous – a box a little wider than its
  text reads as designed, a box narrower reads as broken. Where it matters,
  give an explicit `w`.
- **No pie chart.** A pie asks a reader to compare angles, which people do
  badly and inconsistently, and Carter's advice is to avoid one unless you know
  exactly why you want it. The form to reach for instead, for parts of a whole,
  is a stacked bar – `series of … stacked` – which reads off a shared baseline
  and, unlike two pies, can be set beside another one and compared.
- **No constraint solver.** Positions are expressions over other positions,
  resolved by one topological walk. A circular arrangement is an error naming
  the line, where a solver would instead render it plausibly wrong.
