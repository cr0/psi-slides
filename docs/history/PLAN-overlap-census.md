# The overlap census is blind to a line struck through by an outline

Written from a measured case, not a suspicion. `lectures/network-security`
`#ns-a41` shipped for the length of this branch with its verification block
printed across the bottom outline of the box above it, and the build said
nothing. A critic's pass over the rendered frames found it; `--check-fit`,
`lint.js` and `npm run gate` were all green on it.

## What the census does today

`dgOverlapWarnings` in `diagram-core.mjs` (around line 7576) compares every
pair of authored nodes at every beat both are visible, skips containment, and
reports a pair that overlaps at *every* such beat. It carries two tolerances:

```js
const DG_OVERLAP_TOL = 2;        // px, between two drawn shapes
const DG_OVERLAP_TOL_TEXT = 24;  // px, where either side is a text's line box
```

The 24 is not arbitrary and the comment above it says why: a `text`'s box is
the **line box**, which carries the font's leading above and below the glyphs
and draws no outline, so two correctly-spaced captions overlap by most of a
line's leading with clear air between the words. Two real false positives are
named there, 63x16 and 5x19.

## The two halves of the blind spot

Measured on a three-chunk repro deck, painted at 1600x900 and read back out
of the browser (`viewBox` width against the painted width gives the scale):

| case | painted overlap | figure scale | compiler px | reported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| text across a box's bottom edge | 145 x 28 | 1.9 | 76 x 14.7 | no |
| text further into the box | 145 x 45 | 1.9 | 76 x 23.7 | no |
| two boxes | 57 x 46 | 1.9 | 30 x 24 | yes |

1. **The tolerance is applied to both axes, and the defect is one-axis by
   construction.** A text crossing a box's horizontal edge intersects it by a
   fraction of one line's height. That is *the* shape of "a label struck
   through by an outline", and a 24 px floor on the vertical axis is more than
   a line's ink, so the geometry the check exists for is the geometry it
   cannot see. `#ns-a41` was 14.7 compiler px on that axis.

2. **The px are the compiler's, not the room's.** A figure is scaled to fill
   its canvas, and since the fixed canvas landed that scale is usually above
   1. At 1.9x the effective tolerance on the projection is 46 px - three lines
   of figure label. The author reading the word "px" in the message reads it
   as the px they can see.

## The fix, as landed

Done; the rule and what it costs an author are in the `psi-slides-figures`
skill, the gate is `test/gates/overlap.mjs`. Insetting by the half-leading
alone was not enough – it leaves a two-line label as wide as its longest line,
which is how the chevron in `#ns-a49` came to intersect a block it does not
touch. A text is compared as the rectangles it inks, one per line.

## The unit, as landed

Naming the unit, not scaling the number: the compiler cannot know the fit
scale, because the fit happens in the page. The message now reads
"overlap by 5.38x0.06 rows (215x3 px of the drawing's own grid, which the
slide scales to fill its canvas)". Rows on both axes, because a `gap` is
measured in `uh` on both axes and `gap` is what the sentence after the number
tells the author to write – so the figure is the one that goes on that line.
Gate: `test/gates/overlap.mjs`, which holds the spelling, refuses a bare px
figure, and checks the two numbers are one quantity twice.

The same reading of the other px in `diagram-core.mjs` found three more
messages, and none of them was changed. The elbow rail, the elbow's arrival
run and the exposed run already lead with units or labels and carry the px in
brackets. The edge-label clip and the band overflow carry bare px, but
neither number is the one an author edits against – the band overflow hands
over `w <n>` in the band's own unit, and the clip's advice is qualitative
(a wider gap, a shorter label, a `\n`).

## What else that pass turned up, not in this slice

- **`#ns-b22` sets its labels at 13.2 px against 28.4 px of body type**
  (0.46x, the smallest on the drawing 10.5 px). Pre-existing, reported by
  `--check-fit` as a note, and the one figure in the deck still behind its
  own slide. It needs redrawing, not an engine change.
- **`dim` is an opacity, so anything behind a dimmed box shows through it.**
  `#ns-b05` dimmed two filter boxes and the wire behind them struck the word
  standing in them. The fix in the deck was to take the accent off by name
  (`style fwd, fws {!tone-4 !emph}`) instead. Whether `dim` should keep its
  fill opaque is a design question worth asking once.
- **A text fully inside a box is exempt, a text crossing its edge is not.**
  Correct, and it surprises an author shrinking a figure: captions that were
  inside start being reported. Worth one sentence in the figures skill.
