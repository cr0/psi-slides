/**
 * Re-shoots the site's screenshots from lectures/python-intro, plus the two
 * from lectures/diagrams (the diagram editor, and a stepped slide for the
 * figures page), the five decoration.html needs
 * from lectures/decoration, and the four-frame cue-card sequence from
 * lectures/spoken-talk. One row is not a view at all: four pages of
 * python-intro's slides.pdf, exported by build.js and rasterised by pdftoppm
 * (poppler), which that row alone needs.
 *
 *   node docs/site/shoot.mjs                 # all of them, into docs/site/img/
 *   node docs/site/shoot.mjs cockpit search  # just those two
 *   node docs/site/shoot.mjs --keep-png      # leave the PNGs beside the WebP
 *
 * Requires the lectures to be built first (`node build.js
 * lectures/python-intro/source.md`, and the same for lectures/diagrams and
 * lectures/decoration if their shots are in the run), `playwright-core` from
 * devDependencies, and a Chromium: $PSI_CHROME wins, then a browser in the Playwright cache,
 * then the system Google Chrome. Encoding needs cwebp or magick on PATH; with
 * neither, the PNGs are kept and the WebP step is skipped with a note.
 *
 * Why a script and not a manual pass with the screenshot key:
 *
 * - The shots have to be reproducible. They are all the same chunk of the
 *   same lecture in six different views, and hand-taken versions drifted in
 *   framing and in size (one shipped at 860 px while the rest were 1440).
 * - `chrome --headless --screenshot` cannot do it. It captures from the
 *   document origin, cannot scroll, and cannot press a key, so a live view is
 *   only ever photographed in its initial state. A driver can put the deck in
 *   the state each figure is about and wait for the camera to settle.
 * - deviceScaleFactor is where the resolution comes from. The viewport stays
 *   at the size the shots were composed at (1440x900) and only the pixel
 *   density goes up, so the layout is identical and the type is not resampled.
 *
 * The editor shot is the one that comes from another lecture, and it has to:
 * the editor ships into a live view only where the lecture has a diagram, and
 * python-intro has none. lectures/diagrams is the reference for every
 * construct, its frontmatter names no `editor:` key so it gets the default
 * `both`, and its four views are tracked, so the shot can never be taken of a
 * lecture nobody rebuilt. It is addressed by fragment rather than walked,
 * because what the shot is about is inside a modal that opens over whichever
 * chunk the camera is on, not the walk that got there.
 *
 * The cue-card sequence is four frames of one slide, and it comes from
 * lectures/spoken-talk. It has to come from somewhere written for the mode:
 * the cards are for a talk that is written out word for word, and the
 * tutorial's notes are examples of note syntax, so a frame of them shows the
 * rail and not the reason for it. spoken-talk exists for this - see the
 * comment at the top of its source.
 *
 * The audience view is walked to the target chunk with the arrow keys rather
 * than addressed by fragment. That was a workaround for the bug where the
 * browser scrolled #psiINT-stage-viewport to the fragment target and left the camera
 * framing empty space; the runtime resets that scroll now (see
 * resetViewportScroll in build.js), and the walk stays because it is also
 * what a lecturer does, and because the assertion below is worth keeping
 * honest against a fragment path that has been wrong once.

// ── when these shots are stale ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing checks that. The ids above are checked, because an id is the one
// part of a shot that can be decided without drawing it; freshness cannot,
// and a gate that pretends otherwise is worse than none, because a green run
// is read as an assurance.
//
// A shot is not a function of source.md alone. It is the lecture, plus the
// stylesheets and runtime inlined by build.js, plus this rig, plus the
// Chromium that drew it. So the trigger to re-shoot is not a file:
//
//   the live views' chrome moved, a viewer default changed, or anything
//   moved a label or an extent.
//
// Both drifts that reached the published site were that and not a lecture
// edit. cockpit.webp predated the clock becoming a large button in the top
// right corner. Six python-intro shots predated the `bold:` default changing
// from accent-bold to plain. A hash over the lecture sources would have
// stayed green through both.
//
// A change that reaches the whole deck is a re-shoot only where a shot frames
// something it touches. python-intro went to style: {blocks: left} deck-wide,
// which moved the code slides in it and left collapsed, full and search
// untouched - those three frame a chunk with no code block. The same walk the other way:
// a chunk inserted between the two the document rig frames moved the margin
// number of the second and not the first, so printed changed and the two
// 470-row handout crops, which stop above the second number, did not. Read the
// number off the shot before deciding; it is four pixels of evidence against
// an afternoon of re-encoding.
//
// And the trigger list above is incomplete in a way worth stating, because it
// is what the two rules on either side of it would both miss: a shot can go
// stale from an edit to a chunk it does not frame and does not show. The stage
// is a continuous column and the camera's translate is computed from the active
// chunk's offset in it, so growing an upstream chunk moves the frame. Measured:
// rewriting two sentences in the decoration chunk directly above #reveal-close
// took that chunk from 1001px to 1271px, which landed the frame 0.56 CSS px
// lower and changed deco-backdrop. Three builds settled it - old engine with
// old source, new with new, and new with only those two sentences reverted, the
// third byte-identical to the first. So neither "did the framed chunk change"
// nor a reading of the diff decides this. Running the rig does.
//
// A pixel-difference count is not that measurement, and it misleads in both
// directions. deco-backdrop is a full-frame gradient, so a one-pixel shift lit
// up 26 % of the image; a screenshot of text where one word changed lights up
// almost nothing. Roll the new shot by a pixel or two and see which offset fits
// best, then look at the two pictures. And check that the shot is reproducible
// before blaming a change for it: two runs of deco-backdrop came back
// byte-identical to each other and both differed from the committed file, which
// is what turned "the rig is noisy" into "the file is out of date".
//
// The threshold is whether a reader would see the difference at the size the
// page displays the shot. Both of those were visible at reading size. A prose
// edit two tiles deep in the overview thumbnail is not, and the honest answer
// there is to write the shot down as known-stale and let the next visible
// reason carry it, rather than to churn twenty shots for pixels nobody reads.
//
// That answer is about COST, though, and the cost is not always twenty shots.
// Where the change is real, reproducible and confined to one file, take it even
// when it is invisible: shoot.mjs names its shots, so one is 25 KB rather than
// eleven binaries and the manual. What that buys is a tree where running the
// rig produces no diff - and a diff only means something where its absence
// means something too. A repository whose shot rig always reports changes
// teaches the next person to skip past them.
//
// One coupling that is easy to miss: docs/artifact/refresh-figures.mjs inlines
// img/editor.webp into figures-you-write.html, because that page fetches
// nothing at run time. A re-shoot therefore drifts a page under docs/artifact/,
// and pages.yml runs refresh-figures --check before it assembles the site. Run
// it after shooting, and commit the manual with the images.
