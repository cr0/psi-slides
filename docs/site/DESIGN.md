# The site's design, and why it is that way

This is the brief the project site was rebuilt against, kept so a later
change can be checked against the reasoning rather than against a
screenshot. The rules live in `site.css`, where each one carries its own
comment; this file is the layer above that, the part that no single rule
explains.

Its companion is `desktop/DESIGN.md`, which does the same job for the
builder app.

## What the site is for

A lecturer decides in about a minute whether a tool is worth an evening.
The site has to make the argument in that minute and then get out of the
way, so it is ordered: convince first, act second. The last two sections
are the only ones that ask for anything.

## The one problem this site has that most do not

**Every picture on it is a picture of text.** A slide full of prose, a
handout, a cockpit of small type. Put one directly under a paragraph and
the reader cannot tell where the page stops and the picture starts, nor
which text is caption and which is body. Three layouts were built and
thrown away before that was named, and every symptom they showed – "busy",
"crowded", "exhausting" – came back to it.

Three rules follow, and they are the reason the page looks the way it
does:

1. **A picture stands on a stage.** `.stage` is a field of `--stage`, the
   page's ground stepped down, running the full frame with two to three
   rem of air inside it. Between prose and pixels there are two edges
   (`--paper` → `--stage` → `--shot-bg`) instead of one, and the space
   around a picture is unmistakably larger than the space between two
   paragraphs. A field is not an ornament: no shadow, no stripe, no card
   around every block.
2. **The sentence goes in front of the picture, not behind it.** Every
   figure has a `.cue` that says what to look at and why. A caption after
   the fact is read after the confusion it was meant to prevent.
3. **Two stages in a row need more air than one stage after a paragraph.**
   `.second-picture` carries that, and it is a rule because the first
   version had the class in the markup with no CSS behind it and the two
   fields touched.
4. **The air goes under a stage as well as over it.** The first version of
   this system gave a picture room above and nothing below, so the row of
   text explaining it started against the picture's edge and read as part
   of it. The same seam is set on `.beside + .pair-up` and its siblings.
5. **A picture is as large as what it has to show, and no larger.** A
   screenshot at 16:10 across the whole frame is over 800px tall: it
   pushes everything else off the screen, and a reader who scrolls past it
   has lost where they were. So each stage answers what its picture is
   for. One whose details the text discusses keeps its size, or is shot as
   a crop; one that stands there as evidence goes small, and the text that
   would have sat above it moves into the free half beside it.

   **For a drawing the rule has a number, and it is the type.** A compiled
   `::: draw` label is 15 units in the figure's own grid, and the prose it
   stands among is 19px, so a figure is drawn at about its viewBox width
   times 19/15 &ndash; its labels then read at the size of the sentences beside
   them. Larger than that is a diagram shouting over the text that
   introduces it: the three boxes on the case page `figures.html` used to be
   were drawn 1187px wide for a drawing 719 units across and their labels
   came out at 25px. The frame's full width is what a figure gets when the
   number asks for MORE than the frame, which on that page was true of
   exactly one of the four.
   A figure narrower than its stage is **centred** on it: the stage is a
   field, a field's margin is even, and the stage itself still starts at
   the frame's left edge, so the page's one left edge is untouched.

   **For a screenshot the question is which branch applies**, and the test
   is whether its own type can be read at the width the page can give it.
   The diagram editor's interface is 13px in a 1920px shot, which is 7.9px
   at the frame's width: nobody reads it, so it is evidence and goes small.
   Where the answer is a crop, **crop the shot rather than arrange around
   it** &ndash; change the height in `shoot.mjs`'s shot table and re-take it, so
   the crop is reproducible. The two handout shots went from 690 to 470
   viewport rows for that reason: the second chunk of the document carried
   nothing the first did not, and the shot was 762px tall against 240px of
   words beside it. A crop is measured against the type it was composed
   at: when the documents' screen type grew from 13.3 to 15px, 470 rows
   ended above the chunk's notes, and the crop became 640 rows starting at
   the chunk's own heading.

The cue stays **outside** the stage on purpose. Inside it, the triad
collapses to two and the device loses the job it was built for.

**A drawing gets the same stage as a screenshot**, which was decided rather
than inherited. A compiled `::: draw` figure is mostly air and a dozen labels,
so it has the picture-of-text problem more weakly than a slide does &ndash; but
it has a second one the screenshots do not: the compiler paints in the page's
own tokens, so a box is filled `--paper` and outlined `--ink` on a page whose
ground is `--paper`. Dropped straight onto the page a figure has no edge at
all. What it does not get is a window bar, because there is no window; that is
what `.shot.drawn` says on the front page.

## The layout: one frame, one left edge, two stops

The page is one frame, centred in the viewport. Inside it there is exactly
one vertical line at which anything begins: the frame's left edge. Nothing
is centred inside it, nothing is offset, nothing breaks out.

To the right there are two stops. Prose ends at `--measure`; anything that
is looked at rather than read – a screenshot, a gallery, a table, a
listing – runs to the frame's edge.

A third stop is narrower rather than wider: `--measure-col`, for text
belonging to a column, a card or a picture instead of to the page. Prose
at the page's measure runs to about 75 characters, which is right for a
paragraph a reader settles into; the same width inside one half of a
two-column row reads as a wall, because the eye is switching between the
halves rather than running down one. This is the distinction `--fs-note`
draws in the type scale, and the two are set together.

**Why not a common centre.** The version before this one had three track
widths centred on one middle. That gives one centre and three different
left edges, and reading follows the left edge: inside a single section the
eye had to find the column again three times. A shared centre is an
alignment nobody reads.

**Why not one column for everything.** The version before *that* held
prose and pictures at one width and let pictures break out with a
transform. Prose and pictures then stood on two left edges, and a third of
a wide screen was empty.

### Never a half-empty row, and the band that answers it

The failure mode two earlier attempts shared: an element uses half the
width and nothing stands beside it. One-sided whitespace reads as a
mistake; symmetrical whitespace reads as intent.

The version before this one answered that inside the row, with a rule
about what may be *written*: the words column had to be a heading and
three to five lines, never a paragraph that happened to be there, so that
the hole under it would be small enough to read as margin. That rule was
right about the diagnosis and wrong about the remedy. It is a constraint
on the author, it was broken by every section that needed a sixth line,
and each break was patched where it showed rather than where it came
from &ndash; so the same fault came back on a different page each time. The
client's word for it, three rebuilds running, was that the page looked
broken.

**A band takes the answer out of the writing and puts it in the geometry.**
A band is one row at the frame's full width, words on one side and a stage
on the other, and the words are **centred against the stage**
(`align-items: center`, which is the whole of it). The space left over is
then split above and below the words instead of piling up underneath.
The column may be four lines or nine; the row is right either way, and no
section has to be written to a length.

Two things follow, and they are the rest of the rule:

- **What may follow a band is a block at the frame's width.** A band ends
  at full width and the next thing begins at full width, so nothing after
  a band lines itself up against anything inside it. This is where the
  fault used to hide once it had been chased out of the rows: a stage 500px
  tall beside three lines of words, and then the button, the table or the
  next paragraph starting *under the hole*, at the left edge, with nothing
  above it for half a screen. A sentence that belongs to the words goes in
  the words column; a heading, a button, a row of three, a listing is its
  own block. `.beside + *` carries the seam, and it is `*` on purpose: the
  list form of that selector was itself the symptom, one line added per
  section that opened a hole.
- **Not everything is a band.** A band is a thought with a piece of
  evidence beside it. Where there is no picture there is nothing to stand
  beside, and the block takes the frame or the measure: the three lecture
  cards and the fold under them on the front page, the two warnings about
  unsigned packages, the four design principles, the closing links.
  A paragraph at `--measure` with ground to its right is not a half-empty
  row; it is the page's own margin, the same margin every lede has.

#### The heading is not in the band

A section heading names the section, not one of its columns, so it stands
**above** the band at the frame's left edge. Inside the words column it was
centred with everything else and floated at half the height of the picture
beside it, which is a heading anywhere but at the top of what it names; and
it had to be set two steps down from the site's h2 to survive a 24rem
column, so the page carried two h2 sizes depending on whether a section
happened to be a band. A contact sheet is scanned by heading size.

An **h3** stays in the column. It names the column rather than the section,
there can be several in one section, and lifting one out would make a
sub-heading read as a section heading. What it gets instead is the row
below: `site.css` puts it on the row's first line and starts the listing
beside it level with the prose under it, which is what a listing answers.

#### …unless the words are much shorter than the stage

That rule holds while the words column is nearly as tall as the stage: the
heading is at the top of what it names and the row starts under it, filled on
both sides. Where the column is **much** shorter it is wrong, and the fault is
the band's own, moved one element up. The column is centred, so it starts
halfway down; the heading stays at the top; and between them stands a hole a
third of a screen deep with the picture beside it. A heading that names a
section whose text begins 200px below it names nothing.

So where the words are much shorter than the stage, **the heading goes back
into the words column, and heading and words are centred against the stage
together, as one block.** Nothing floats: the column is a single stack from
its first line to its last, and the space left over is split above and below
it – the band's own answer, applied to one element more.

Three things follow.

- **It is a decision per section, not a rule CSS derives.** The heights come
  from the picture and from the number of sentences, and a stylesheet cannot
  be asked "is this much shorter". So it is a class, `.beside.heading-in`, and
  each one is set after measuring. Measured at 1440 in both languages, the
  bands that carry it are 39–68 % of their stage's height; the ones left alone
  are 79–88 %.
- **The heading follows its text column, wherever that stands.** The h2 is a
  child of `.said`, so a mirrored band carrying it would put the heading on
  the right. No band does today, and the reason is the rule's own limit: a
  **mirrored** band has no hole under its heading, because what stands under
  the heading is the stage, which starts at the row's top edge and is the tall
  half. The fault exists only where the heading and the short column are on
  the same side. Which is also why mirroring a band is never the fix for it –
  the side a band takes is decided by *Which side the stage takes* below, and
  a band that turns round to hide a hole has stopped meaning anything by the
  turn.
- **Such a band needs more air over and under it**, and the amount is
  measurable rather than chosen: exactly what the heading used to contribute
  above the row. At 1440 that is the h2's line box (46.4px at line-height 1.1
  = 51px) plus its 21px margin – 72px that used to stand between the previous
  section and this row and no longer does. It is given back above *and* below,
  because the section now ends without a structural mark too. 72px on a 172px
  gap is 42 %, so the band's padding goes up by half: 6vw → 9vw, and the two
  clamp ends with it. The gap is then 216px against a neighbour and 259
  between two such bands. The section gap was doing three quarters of the work
  of separating two sections; now it does all of it.

The heading keeps the site's **one** h2 size. Setting it two steps down to
survive a 24rem column is what gave the page two h2 sizes depending on whether
a section happened to be a band, and a contact sheet is scanned by heading
size. What gives instead is the line count: a heading is three or four lines
at 24rem, and three lines of h2 is a heading, not a problem.

**The same decision one heading level down.** An h3 stays in its column, and
what it gets instead is *the row below* – the heading on the row's first line,
the listing beside it starting level with the prose under it. That is right
while the column is nearly as tall as the listing, and it is the same rule
with the same limit: where the column is **much** shorter, the heading is
pinned to the row's top edge, its own words are not, and between them stands
the hole again. So `.heading-in` carries this level too, on an `.aside-code`,
and it needs no second mechanism – `.aside-code` is already centred, so
switching the drop off (`:not(.heading-in)` on that block's selectors) leaves
heading and words as one centred stack.

Two differences from the h2 case, both from the same source: the hole is under
the words rather than under the heading, so **the measurement is the hole and
not a ratio.** At 1440 the two rows on "In the room" left 99px and 95px of
nothing under four lines of words in English, 71 and 67 in German; centred,
the same room is 28px over and under, and 14 in German. The three rows on
"Getting started" keep the drop and needed no measuring: their columns are
109–120 % of their listings, so there is no hole to split. And **the air is
needed above only.** A row like this is inside a section rather than being
one, so nothing ends without a mark; what it loses is the top edge its heading
used to make, which was separating it from the paragraph that introduces it at
35px. The seam takes the page's own number for a row against its neighbour,
the clamp on `.beside + *`: 72px at 1440.

#### Which side the stage takes

Not alternation. A page that flips every section has stopped meaning
anything by it, and that is the first step towards looking like a product
page.

- A band that carries the argument **one step further** keeps the reading
  direction: words left, evidence right. Most bands are this.
- A band that shows a **comparison** &ndash; the same thing twice, two
  executions of one job, two ways to the same place &ndash; turns it round:
  the stage leads and the words are the verdict on it. There are two on
  the front page (the slide as the room sees it and as the reader gets it;
  the two handouts under one switch), one on "In the room" (the two ways
  back to slide forty), one on "A slide is a frame" (two ways of putting
  words on a picture).

The same question decides `.aside-code`, whose evidence is a listing rather
than a picture: the listing is the wide half either way, and which side it
takes follows the same rule.

#### The one place centring is wrong

`.beside.level` exists for a row whose second column is a **disclosure**.
A band is centred because the difference in height is fixed; a fold is
64px shut and eight screens open, so a centred first column would sit
still and then walk four screens down the moment a reader opened it. The
reader sets that height, so that row stays top-aligned. One caller,
`getting-started.html`, "From a machine with nothing on it".

#### Airy, as numbers

"Not airy" is the complaint a page gets when its distances are right in
relative terms and small in absolute ones, so they are set against each
other here rather than chosen.

- **The gutter of a row against the gap between sections.** The section gap
  is 172px at 1440 and 230 at 1920. A band's gutter is 52 and 67 &ndash; about a
  third &ndash; which still reads as one row. At 36px, which is what it was, the
  words stood against the picture's edge; at the section gap the two halves
  would stop being a row at all.
- **What a block keeps inside its own field.** DESIGN.md asked for two to
  three rems of air inside a stage and got 1.7 at 1440, because the `vw`
  term topped out before the `rem` cap did. A picture that runs to within
  32px of the field it stands on reads as pressed into it whatever space
  the page has elsewhere. The stage keeps 2.2rem at 1440 and 2.8 at 1920;
  a listing's recess and a bordered card were raised with it.

#### The gutter of a two-column prose row

`.pair-up` used to take half the frame per column and hold its prose at
`--measure-col` inside that. Above about 1600px the column outran the cap
and the difference came out as gutter &ndash; 137px between two paragraphs on
the case page `figures.html` was then, which reads as two unrelated pages side
by side. The cap
belongs on the row: two measures and a 3rem gutter is what the pattern
*is*, and what is left over stands at the frame's right edge, where the
page already leaves ground under every paragraph.

#### The front page's air

The front page has to read as a front page in the first second, before a
word is read, and the device for that is the air over the hero. But the
hero is also the one seam on the site where more air costs something: the
screenshot pair under it is the page's argument, and pushing it down the
window is how a visitor comes to see a heading and nothing else.

**So the hero's extra air is a function of the window's height, not its
width, and it is the site's only height-gated rule.** The distances here
scale with `vw`, and the hero did too &ndash; `clamp(2rem,
3vw, 3.5rem)`, which `.band-hero` still carries for the pages that are not
the front page. Measured, that turns out to be the wrong axis. A 1920x930
window got the largest padding in the set, 56px, while having the least
room under the fold; a 2560x1300 window with 389px to spare got the same
56. What is scarce above the first picture is height. Width is what the
`.beside` columns already answer.

**The air is bought, not borrowed.** The size that decides whether the hero
works is not the padding, it is how much of the screenshot pair stands above
the fold when the page loads, and the two move against each other: raising
the padding by P while the stage loses S leaves that share unchanged exactly
when P = share &times; S. So the hero's stage was made about a tenth narrower
than a band's stage elsewhere. The pictures are seated to their column, a
tenth off the width is roughly a tenth off the height, and that height is the
budget the padding spends. On the tightest window of the set, 1440x700, where
two thirds of the pair is above the fold, only two thirds of what the stage
gives up may be spent &ndash; and even after spending it, the visible share
goes up rather than down.

**Where the tenth goes is the other half of the rule.** The hero's stage
stands on the left, so its right-hand neighbour is the words column. Take
width off the stage and change nothing else and the freed pixels all land in
the gutter, where 52px becomes 147 and an interval reads as a hole. The words
take most of it &ndash; the column runs `clamp(24rem, 33vw, 31rem)` instead of
a flat 24rem, and at 31rem the two cues in it set about 62 characters a line,
inside what `--measure-col` already allows a paragraph that belongs to a
picture &ndash; and the gutter takes four or five pixels, enough that it grows
with the row instead of standing still while everything round it moves. The
`vw` term keeps the narrowest desktop out of the trade: below about 1160px
the column is back at 24rem and the row is what it was.

**The German page paid for this seam twice, so it is fixed here too.** At the
old 40rem the English lede set three lines and the German four, which put the
German screenshot pair 32px lower on the same window. German reaches three
lines at 46rem and English does not fall to two until 55rem, so `.hero-said`
takes 47rem on a desktop window. It is `--fs-lead`, so the longer line is not
more characters than `--measure` allows the page's prose &ndash; roughly the
same 65.

**The rule is continuous now, and that is what the budget bought.** It used to
be a step: below 1000px of viewport height the taller value did not apply at
all, because without a narrower stage a pixel added at 1440x700 was a pixel of
the pair lost, and the safe thing was a selector that did not match there.
With a budget on every desktop height, `clamp(3.5rem, 8vh, 7.5rem)` spends it
in the proportion the fold has anyway &ndash; 56px at 700, 62 at 780, 74 at
930, 86 at 1080 &ndash; and no window meets a jump in the hero's spacing. The
ceiling is `.band`'s own `7.5rem`: the hero joins the rhythm the other
sections keep, it does not out-space a section. The floor is what the widest
short window got before, so the rule only ever adds. It is still gated on
width, at the 68rem where `.beside` becomes two columns, so a portrait tablet
and a tall phone keep today's spacing to the pixel.

**Only the front page takes it.** The four subpages open with the same
`.band-hero` and no stage under it, and a heading that stands lower for no
reason is a page that looks like it is missing something above the fold.
`index.html` and `index.de.html` carry a second class, `band-hero-home`,
and both the padding and the narrower stage name that one alone. Measured
across all eleven built pages at 390x844, 768x900, 1100x800, 1440x900 and
1920x1080, the two front pages move on the three desktop widths and nothing
else moves anywhere.

**What the measurement has to show.** Padding alone proves nothing; the check
is the visible share of the stage at load, both languages, on every window in
the set. After the trade it rises on the windows that had a fold problem
&ndash; 1440x700 goes from 65 % to 67 % in English and 55 % to 65 % in German,
1512x850 from 90 % to 98 % in German &ndash; holds at 100 % where it was
already whole, and is unchanged on 768 and 390 where the hero stacks. Padding
is up on every desktop window: 43 to 56 at 1440x700, 45 to 68 at 1512x850, 56
to 74 at 1920x930, 101 to 115 at 2560x1440.

#### The two ways to start

The hero names the two ways in before anything else asks for attention: a
cue – download the app and choose **New lecture…**, or see the tutorial first –
and two buttons that take them. Stacked under the lede, cue then button row,
they cost the screenshot pair more than the trade above had bought: at
1440x900 the German pair lost its bottom tenth, and at 1440x700 the visible
share fell from about two thirds to 37 % in English and 26 % in German.

**So on a desktop window the buttons stand beside the cue**, centred against it
the way a band's words are centred against its stage, and the routes cost the
height of the cue rather than the cue plus a row. `.hero-said` becomes a grid
there: the lede spans it and keeps its 47rem by itself, the cue takes up to
`--measure`, and the buttons take what they need. The cue column is what
yields on a narrow desktop window, and the lede is kept out of the track
sizing (`contain: inline-size`) or its width widens the button column until the
cue sets eight lines at 1100. Under 68rem the three stack as before. Both
routes stay on the first screen in both languages at 390x844 as well, which in
German took a few pixels off the line over the h1 and the h1's own margin on the
front page alone.

Measured as the visible share of the pair's box at load: 1440x900 is 100 % in both languages again (German was
91 %); 1440x700 is 64 % in English and 62 % in German (37 % and 26 % with the
stacked cue); 1100x800 is 100 % and 91 % (84 % and 65 %).

## Colour

**The page is not white.** Everything the site shows a picture of is
itself near-white, so on a white ground a screenshot dissolved into the
page and only a hairline said where it ended. The ground is a soft warm
grey; the artefacts sit on it as white objects. That is the one job the
palette has to do, and it is why `--paper` may get better but must not go
back to white.

Four surfaces, each a real step from the ground rather than the one and a
half per cent they used to share: `--shot-bg` white for a card or a
screenshot, `--stage` for the field a picture stands on, `--code-bg` a
recess for a listing, and two rules. Contrast is measured on rendered
pixels, not on the token strings – Chrome returns `oklch()` as `oklch()`,
so a check through `getComputedStyle` sees every pair at 2.2:1 and passes
everything. The weakest real pair is 5.3:1, a caption on the stage, and
that is what has kept the stage from going darker.

**There is no band alternation.** Two tints one and a half per cent apart
separated nothing and still added an event every few screens. What
separates two sections is the gap, and the gap is large enough to read as
one.

**The page has an ending.** The closing band changes ground across the
full width and carries the further reading and the byline together. No
rule above the byline: the change of field already separates, and a line
inside it would be one mark too many.

## Type

The two families are fixed: IBM Plex Sans and JetBrains Mono, served from
this origin. That is an argument, not a preference – the lectures set the
same faces, so a screenshot and the page around it are the same type. A
Google Fonts link would also tell a third party who reads the page of a
tool whose whole point is that its output fetches nothing.

Sizes and weights are free and have moved: `h2` sits at roughly two and a
half times the body, because at 1.3× nine sections read as one on a
contact sheet.

**Text is sized off `--fs-body`, never in `rem`.** `body` sets 19px and the
root element stays at the browser's 16px, so a size written in `rem` is
measured against a size no text on this page has, and every one of them came
out smaller than its number reads – a caption at 0.92rem is 14.7px, 77 % of
the prose beside it, and a gallery label at 0.82rem is 13.1px, 69 %. Nobody
chose those ratios. `index.html` carried five sizes of `p` and three of
`.lede` for that reason alone, and the client's word for the result was
*mickrig*.

Four steps, in `site.css` at the top: `--fs-body` for prose, `--fs-lead` one
step up for the sentence under a heading, `--fs-note` at 90 % for text that
belongs to a picture or a box rather than to the page (a cue, a caption, a
card, a table, the footer, every button label), `--fs-fine` at 80 % for a
label that is never a sentence. `--fs-code` is the sans scale read in mono.
Lengths stay in `rem`: raising the root would have fixed the ratios and
multiplied `--page`, `--measure`, every padding and every breakpoint by 1.19
with them.

Two things follow, and both are the reason a size change is not a one-line
change. **Bigger text in a fixed column is fewer characters a line**, so
`.beside` went from 21rem to 24rem and `.aside-code` from 20 to 23 – the
column is the adjustment, not the size; nothing on the site now sets prose at
under 45 characters. And **the window bar is not in the scale**: it is chrome
inside a picture, sized by what fits one line, the same category as the
topbar. The pair of shots on one stage now shares its grid rows, so a bar
that does wrap makes both bars that height and the two pictures still start
on one line – which German never did.

Ligatures are off in the mono family everywhere, and the rule lists every
selector that sets `--mono` rather than four element names. The figure
grammar spells an arrow `->` and a plain line `--`; a face that ligates
those draws one glyph where the author has to type two characters.

## Interaction

Two devices on this site, and both follow the same rule: **a control
answers an action, it never runs on its own.** No scroll-triggered
motion.

- **The chooser** shows one option at a time and puts its options in a row of
  tabs above. Click rather than hover, because a hover switch has no answer
  on a touchscreen and it is the only route to the options that are not
  first. The tabs are real buttons: focusable, Enter and Space. Without
  JavaScript the options stand under each other with their labels above them,
  and the section still says what it came to say.

  It carries two things, and that it is one mechanism rather than two is the
  point – a second way of switching something would be a second thing for a
  reader to learn and a second thing to keep operable from a keyboard.
  **The three ways** on the front page are an argument in three moves, so its
  labels carry the judgement ("not ideal", "our approach") the prose used to
  make. **The cue-card sequence** on "In the room" is four frames of one
  window, one per press of the space bar, because what that mode does is move
  the cards and the projection together and a still cannot show a change. Its
  labels are paragraphs rather than headings: that page's headings are the
  anchors its two languages are linked by, and the twin gate counts them.

  The front page used to carry a third, the two ways in – the app beside the
  command line – under a "Getting started" band. That band has left the front
  page: the two routes are now two buttons in the hero (see *The two ways to
  start*), and the page they lead to, `getting-started.html`, takes the app
  first and the command line after it as two plain sections, with nothing to
  switch.
- **The handout switch** opens on `print.html`, the file that is handed
  out, and swaps to `print-notes.html`. The filename in the title bar
  changes with it, or the bar would be exactly the confusion the switch
  was built against. The two shots are taken in identical geometry on
  purpose: a switch that also changes the crop reads as two pictures
  rather than as one file becoming another.

## What must not appear

The list is the client's, and it is a list of defaults rather than of
mistakes. Each is legitimate somewhere; none is a choice here.

- Accent borders down the left edge of a box.
- Small-caps eyebrow lines above headings.
- A card with a shadow for everything, gradient washes, a row of icons
  with three benefit claims.
- One word in a heading set in colour or italic.
- Numbered markers 01 / 02 / 03 where the content is not a sequence. The
  install steps are numbered, because those *are* a sequence.
- An arrow appended to link or button text.
- Motion that answers scrolling rather than a person.

## Navigation

One bar, not two. The university strip that says who is responsible for the
site is also the site's navigation, because a second row under it would be a
second sticky element for six words, and the strip is already the only thing
that appears on every page.

Its entries come from `SITE_PAGES` in `build-site.js`, one row per page, and
that table is also what the language switch and the link gate read. Taking a
page into the navigation is a row there and nothing else; a row marked
`pending` is a page that has been decided on but not written, and the bar
leaves it out until it exists.

**One page in the bar does not load `site.css`: `figures.html`.** It is
`docs/artifact/figures-you-write.html` &ndash; the case for the figure language
and its manual, one page &ndash; which carries its own stylesheet, fonts and
diagram runtime so that it also opens straight off disk. `build-site.js` puts
the bar in at its `<!--topbar-->` marker and copies the bar's rules out of
`site.css` into its head (`topbarCss()`), so a change to the bar here reaches
that page on the next site build. The rest of this document's layout rules do
not apply to it; its own are in the page's stylesheet and in
`docs/artifact/README.md`.

**One page is off the bar on purpose: the typefaces page,
`display-faces.html`.** It is reached from the decoration page's display-face
section, in both languages, and nowhere else; the file keeps its first name
because links to it exist. It is generated by
`tools/font-playground/build-playground.mjs` – the text faces, then the display
faces – and its mock slides keep the deck's colours rather than the page's, so
they stay light in dark mode, as the screenshots do. Its README has the rest.

**The page you are on is marked, and the mark is not a device.** The entry
carries `aria-current="page"`; the stylesheet answers with the other entries
one shade back and a hairline under this one. Not an accent border, not a
pill, and not bold – the bar's type is 0.78rem on a 30px strip, where one
bolded word of six reads as a rendering fault. The burger panel has room for
weight, so there it is weight: an underline in a column of stacked links reads
as a visited link.

**The strip must never grow a second line**, and it has no room to spare, so
every entry added to it is a re-measurement. The number is in `site.css` beside
the rule that uses it, with what was measured and in which language; build with
`PSI_SITE_NAV_ALL=1` to put every row in the bar first, or the measurement is
of a bar smaller than the one being planned.

## Both languages, structurally identical

`index.html` and `index.de.html` are twins: same sections, same pictures,
same order, same code blocks. What changes in one changes in the other, in
the same commit. Code comments may be translated; the commands may not.

`build-site.js` checks that rather than asking for it. Four things have to
match – the sequence of `h2`/`h3` levels and the ids the English page gives
them, the pictures in order (a shot whose words are in the page's language
comes as `img/x.webp` and `img/x-de.webp` and counts as one picture &ndash; the
prompter's hint is the only one so far), the commands once the `#` comments are cut off,
and the link targets with the two languages' own paths folded together. The
prose between them is free, which is the only definition that survives a real
translation.

## How to check a change

Not by reading the CSS. Build, serve, screenshot, look:

```bash
node docs/site/build-site.js /tmp/site-out
(cd /tmp/site-out && python3 -m http.server 8791)
```

Then, in order of how much each one has caught:

1. **A contact sheet of the whole page.** Full-page screenshot scaled to
   about 28 % and laid out in five columns. Every failure in this
   rebuild's history showed up here first and nowhere else: the busy
   rhythm, the half-empty rows, the sections that read as one.
2. **Clipping, per container.** Page-level overflow
   (`documentElement.scrollWidth > innerWidth`) does not catch a box that
   clips its own content, and that is how a listing shipped with its
   first characters behind the edge. Ask every `pre`, stage, table,
   figure and card whether `scrollWidth > clientWidth`, with the
   disclosures forced open.
3. **390, 768, 1100, 1440, 1920, 2560**, both languages, plus
   `comparison.html`, which inherits this stylesheet, and `figures.html`,
   which does not (see *Navigation*).
4. **Both colour schemes**, and contrast measured on rendered pixels.
5. Keyboard focus visible, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, the chooser
   and the handout switch operable by keyboard, in each place the chooser
   appears.
