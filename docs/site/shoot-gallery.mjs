/**
 * Shoots the cover and divider gallery for the landing page.
 *
 *   node docs/site/shoot-gallery.mjs              # all of them, into docs/site/img/
 *   node docs/site/shoot-gallery.mjs hero panel   # just those
 *   node docs/site/shoot-gallery.mjs --keep-png   # leave the PNGs beside the WebP
 *
 * Why this is a second shooter rather than more rows in shoot.mjs. That script
 * photographs *one chunk of a tracked lecture in six views*: it needs the
 * lectures built, it walks the deck to a target chunk, and every shot shares a
 * source. This one photographs *one composition per deck*, and the reason it
 * cannot share a source is the reason the gallery has to exist at all - a deck
 * has exactly one `cover:` and one `section:`, so ten covers and six dividers
 * are sixteen decks. Folding that into the other shot table would have made
 * both of them conditional on which kind of shot they were.
 *
 * The decks are written and built here, into a temp directory, and thrown away
 * again. Tracking sixteen near-identical lectures to photograph them once
 * would put roughly 7 MB of HTML in the repository for a set of pictures, and
 * nothing in them is worth reading - they exist to be looked at, which is what
 * a picture is for. What *is* worth reading lives in lectures/decoration,
 * which shows every construction a single deck can carry.
 *
 * Reproducibility is the whole point, and it is the same argument the sibling
 * script makes in its own header: sixteen compositions of the same words have
 * to be shot at one size, one viewport and one zoom, or the gallery reads as
 * sixteen different products. Nothing here is composed by hand.
 *
 * Needs `playwright-core` from devDependencies and a Chromium (see
 * shoot-lib.mjs), and cwebp or magick to encode. It does not need any lecture
 * to have been built.
