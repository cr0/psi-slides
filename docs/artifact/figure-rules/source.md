## title: Figure rules | the wrong/right pairs, as compilable figures {#cover}

This lecture exists to be **compiled, not delivered**. Each chunk is one half of
a wrong/right pair from `figure-design.md`, cut down to the fewest elements that
still make the point, and `docs/artifact/refresh-figures.mjs` lifts the emitted
SVG out of the build and into `docs/artifact/figures-you-write.html`.

The drawings in the artifact are produced by the same compiler a real lecture
runs, so a change to the compiler that would break them breaks them *here*
first.

The chunk ids are the contract with the refresh script. Do not rename them.

# Five statements, and nothing in them is a coordinate but the two gaps. Eve
# is placed against Alice and Bob against Eve, so the row is a chain of
# relations; the two wires name their ends and work out their own route.
# The first figure anyone meets on the artifact page, and the one block in
# this lecture with no option tail on the fence and no `at` on the first box.
# The page explains both further down; here they would be two pieces of
# syntax a reader cannot yet read, in a listing whose claim is that it is
# complete.

# The figure at the top of the figures page. Encapsulation drawn as what
# it is - each layer wrapping the one before it - rather than as a stack of
# four bars, which is the same fact drawn as a list.
# It opens finished and the beats walk outwards through it, one header at a
# time, and the last one hands the finished frame to the link.
# Nothing here is a coordinate, and nothing here is a measurement either: every
# outline fits whatever it holds, the hop sizes itself from its own turned
# label, and the arrow is handed two ends. So widening the payload label
# re-fits all three wrappers and re-aims the wire with no number changing
# anywhere - which is the claim the page under it makes, drawn rather than
# asserted.
# The `payload` is 1.5 units where it used to be 1.9: the hero column is 462px
# wide, so what the hop costs across has to be paid for somewhere, and the
# figure fills the gap the shorter column leaves without making the hero
# taller. The gap of 2.2 is the arrow's own label - the one distance in the
# block that has something to hold.

# The cast is written once, at the top, whether or not it is on screen at the
# opening beat. Eve is hidden there because the first thing any step says
# about her is `show` - and her two wires and her outline arrive with her
# without a word, because an edge is only as visible as its ends and an
# outline only as visible as its members.
# Every beat has to fit one frame, so the room Eve will need is reserved
# from the opening beat. At 3.3:1 that reservation rendered as a third of a
# panel of empty paper under two boxes; at 4.4:1 it reads as a margin. The
# gaps here are set for that proportion rather than for the spacing rules.
# Eve is `between` the two rather than `below alice` with an offset, and that is
# the figure practising what its own caption claims. The offset was a guessed
# 1.7 grid units, which put her 28.9px left of the midpoint - close enough to
# centred to read as a mistake rather than as a decision, and wrong again the
# moment either gap changes. `between` states the relation and cannot drift.

# The second beat is one line. Nothing in the figure stores a coordinate, so
# a longer label widens Eve's box, both her arrows re-aim at the sides that
# moved, and the outline re-fits around her. Measured on the emitted
# geometry: the box goes 54 to 116.3 wide, the outline 104.4 to 166.7, and
# each arrow moves 31 pixels, one left and one right. Re-measure these
# numbers if the geometry above changes - the artifact page quotes them.

# The numbers count *flights*, not arrows, which is why they are
# worth drawing: the middle two records travel together, so they carry one
# number and sit half as far apart as the hops either side. A count that runs
