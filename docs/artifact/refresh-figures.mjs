 * Rebuilds every compiled figure in docs/artifact/figures-you-write.html
 * from docs/artifact/figure-rules/source.md.
 *
 *   node docs/artifact/refresh-figures.mjs            # rebuild and splice
 *   node docs/artifact/refresh-figures.mjs --check    # report drift, write nothing
 *
 * The artifact is a hand-written page that embeds machine-made parts: the
 * still figures the rules are argued with, the stepped demos,
 * and the diagram runtime that steps them. Those parts are not authored here
 * and must never be edited here - they are lifted out of a real build of the
 * lecture next door, so a change to the compiler reaches the page by running
 * this script rather than by anyone re-drawing anything.
 *
 * The project site publishes the page as figures.html, with its bar put in at
 * the topbar marker by docs/site/build-site.js. That copy is not written here:
 * this script owns the figures, build-site.js owns the bar.
 *
 * Two things this script exists to get right, both learned by getting them
 * wrong:
 *
 * - **Extract by marker, never by line number.** The runtime was first cut
 *   out of the built page with a fixed line range. Adding two chunks to the
 *   lecture moved it by one line, the slice cut mid-function, and the page
 *   then showed every figure at its *last* beat - because a diagram with no
 *   working runtime shows the static attributes, which are the print state.
 *   It looked like a design decision, not a syntax error. The runtime is now
 *   found between markers and parsed before it is written.
 *
 * - **Re-prefix every lifted id.** The compiler numbers figures per document
 *   (`dg1`, `dg2`, ...), so ids lifted from two different builds collide, and
 *   a duplicate id sends every `url(#...)` in the second copy to the first
 *   one's element - a drawing that arrives with no lines. Each figure is
 *   re-prefixed from its chunk id, which is unique by construction.
