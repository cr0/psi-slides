# figures-you-write.html

The page about `::: draw`, the figure language described in CLAUDE.md under
*Animated infographics*: the case for the language first, then the manual that
teaches it. The project site publishes it as `figures.html`, the bar's
*Figures* entry. Open the file here in a browser and it works the same, minus
the site's bar; it needs no server and fetches nothing at all &ndash; the three
typefaces are embedded as `data:` URIs, which is what the last row below is
about.

It is written by hand, but several regions of it are produced by a script and
must not be edited in the HTML.

## What is in this folder

| | |
|---|---|
| `figures-you-write.html` | the page: the case for the language, then the manual that teaches it from nothing |
| `figure-rules/source.md` | a psi-slides lecture whose only job is to be compiled: every figure the page draws with, including six that step |
| `demo-controls.js` | the arrows, the beat rail and the play button under a stepped figure, and the autoplay of the figure at the top. Inlined by the script |
| `refresh-figures.mjs` | rebuilds that lecture and puts every generated region back into the page |

**The page has been two pages and is one again.** The case (`docs/site/figures.html`)
and the manual stood apart for a while: one page had put `start here` 1,562
words in, behind a manifesto. The split gave the site two pages with one title
that opened on the same seven-line figure, and the manual no site bar. Merged,
the case is the masthead and one section, *Four design principles* (`#why`),
directly under the contents, and `#first-figure` is still where learning
starts. Every section id of the manual survived, and the site's old
`figures-you-write.html` forwards to `figures.html` with its fragment.

`docs/site/build-site.js` publishes the file as `figures.html`: it drops the
`../site/` step from every link, copies the bar's rules out of `site.css` into
the head, and puts the bar in at the `<!--topbar-->` marker. Off disk that
marker is a comment and the page loads nothing.

## What the script owns

Run it after any change to the lecture, to `build.js`, or to
`lectures/network-security/source.md`:

```bash
node docs/artifact/refresh-figures.mjs           # rebuild and splice
node docs/artifact/refresh-figures.mjs --check   # report drift, write nothing (exit 1 on drift)
```

It replaces, keyed by markers in the HTML:

- **Forty-five still figures** &ndash; the masthead figure, the six tutorial steps, the twenty
  wrong/right drawings, the tone row, the thirteen advanced specimens and the
  four still arrangements, taken from a `--print-only` build.
- **Forty-four listings** &ndash; the masthead figure, six tutorial steps (with
  the lines each step adds marked by diffing it against the one before), twenty
  wrong/right halves, thirteen specimens and four arrangements. Each is the block
  its drawing was compiled from, so the two cannot disagree. Three treatments,
  picked by what each listing has to show. The wrong/right halves lose both
  comments and fence, so that only the few lines that differ are left. The four
  arrangements keep both, because the page states their length in lines and half
  a block is not that. The masthead figure keeps its fence, which is what shows
  where a diagram block sits in a lecture file, and drops its comments, which
  are notes to whoever maintains the lecture.
- **Five figures that step** &ndash; drawing, per-beat geometry, the list of
  beat names under it and its listing, from an `--audience-only` build, which
  is the only pass that emits the geometry. `#follow`, which opens the step
  section here, is the only one whose
  listing is stripped of its comments: it has to
  show the *shape* of a stepped block &ndash; the cast at the top, the beats
  underneath, one blank line between &ndash; and six lines of commentary sitting
  in that blank line hide it. Its prose on the page quotes measured pixel
  widths, so re-measure them if the figure's geometry changes.
- **The figure at the top**, `#sitehero`, with its beats and no listing, from
  the same live build. It plays itself.
- **Fifteen gallery figures**, their fifteen listings and their fifteen beat
  rails, read out of `lectures/network-security/source.md`. The line count
  shown in each card comes from the same read.
- **Six webfaces** &ndash; Literata, IBM Plex Sans and JetBrains Mono, upright
  and italic, read out of `node_modules/@fontsource-variable/` and embedded as
  `data:` URIs, 372 KB of base64. The page fetched them from Google Fonts
  before, which is one request telling a third party who reads the
  documentation of a tool whose whole promise is that its outputs fetch nothing
  at run time. All three are SIL OFL 1.1, which permits the embedding and wants
  the notice to travel along; the notice is emitted above the `@font-face`
  rules. **The `-wght-` file, never the `-opsz-` one**: Literata ships both,
  and the optical size axis is what made a 74px heading arrive as a Didone
  while the lectures showed a text face.
- **The diagram runtime**, inside `<script id="psi-dg-runtime">`, and **the
  compiler's stylesheet**, both copied unchanged from the same build. The page
  draws and steps with the code a projected lecture ships rather than a second
  copy that could disagree with it &ndash; and the stylesheet was a hand-made
  copy once, which is how `.mono` labels went on rendering in the wrong face
  here for a commit after the rule causing it had been fixed.
- **Two screenshots**, embedded as `data:` URIs out of `docs/site/img/`: the
  slide of `lectures/diagrams` beside the links to that lecture at the top
  (`diagrams-cbc.webp`), and the editor's window (`editor.webp`). Re-take one
  with `node docs/site/shoot.mjs <name>`, then run the script.
- **The anatomy diagram** at the top, drawn from the code line it annotates.
  Hand-counted, its brackets were one to four columns too wide and the error
  accumulated along the line.

Everything else &ndash; prose, layout and CSS &ndash; is hand-written and safe to
edit. The script under the runtime that wires up the buttons is **not**: it is
`demo-controls.js`, spliced in like the runtime above it, so an edit made in the
HTML is gone on the next refresh. Edit the file.

The chunk ids in the lecture are what the script looks figures up by: `#hero`, `#follow`, `#b1`,
`#r1w`, `#tones`, `#beats-demo`, `#table-demo`, `#seq-demo`, and so on. Rename one in the lecture without
renaming it in `refresh-figures.mjs` and the run stops with an error.

## Two ways this breaks quietly, and the checks that catch them

**A runtime that never ran looks like a design decision.** The attributes
written into a finished diagram describe its last beat &ndash; carrying, in the
one slot that differs, the prominence each element opened with rather than the
prominence a beat lent it &ndash; because that is what a printed copy shows. So a
page whose runtime failed to load displays every figure complete, with nothing
in the console and nothing out of place. The first
version of the lift cut the runtime out of the built page by line number; adding
two chunks to the lecture moved it down one line and the slice ended in the
middle of a function. `refresh-figures.mjs` now finds the runtime between
markers and runs `node --check` over it before writing it into the page.

**Two figures with the same id leave one of them blank.** The compiler numbers
figures per document, so figures taken from two separate builds collide, and
every internal reference in the second copy then resolves against the first
one's element. Each figure is given a new prefix from its chunk id, and the
script refuses to write a page whose figure ids are not unique.

## The lecture is a real lecture

`figure-rules/source.md` builds and lints like any other, and CI lints it. A
change to the compiler that would spoil the page's figures therefore fails
there first, where `node lint.js` and the build's own `[diagram]` warnings can
name the line. Its built views are gitignored; run the refresh script rather
than committing them.

**Its chunk ids are the contract with `refresh-figures.mjs`.** The script pulls
each generated region out by chunk id, so renaming one there without renaming it
in the script breaks the refresh silently - the region simply stops being
updated. Rename both or neither.
