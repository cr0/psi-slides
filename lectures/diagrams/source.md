## title: Animated Infographics {#cover}

This is a psi-slides lecture: one Markdown source becomes the projected slides,
a speaker cockpit, a reading document, and a handout with the spoken notes. The
[psi-slides tutorial lecture](../tutorial/audience.html) introduces the system
itself.

Every figure in this lecture is written in the lecture source, laid out at
build time, and stepped with the same key that advances a reveal.

## outline: Finished pictures first, then the language {.wide #agenda}

**Parts 1 to 3 are six real lecture slides, rebuilt as figures.** The text
under each uses words defined later: Part 4 the pieces, Part 5 the grammar of
one line and of a step, Part 6 five larger arrangements.

## free: Every picture here is text | change one in the source or in the editor {.standard #preview}

**Each drawing in this lecture is a `::: draw` block in `source.md`, under the
heading of the slide it stands on**, so a figure you want to borrow is a
passage you can copy into a lecture of your own.

**Click a figure, then the button in the corner of its focus card, and the
editor opens on it.** With the lecture built under `--watch`, `Cmd`-`S` writes
the change back into `source.md`; opened as a file on its own, the editor
copies the changed block to the clipboard instead. The editor is experimental.

**Two families, one shape.** `flush left` at the end of a placement keeps each `below` chain level at its left edge, though the upper listing runs to two lines and the lower one is a different width; `same as` gives each pair boxes of one size. The *statement* `align x middle tobj, sobj` is a different thing: it hands one coordinate from the first element named to the rest, and it is needed here because the two small boxes hang beside words of different lengths. The two steps name `@temporal` and `@spatial` instead of listing eight names.

**An ordinary Markdown code block on the left, a diagram on the right.** `::: side` puts the two beside each other, and the diagram needs to know nothing about it. The C is invented for the slide; the frame layout beside it is not. Inside, `same as` and `gap 0` hold the four frames together as one stack, and the `brace` spans all four and writes the direction of writing beside them.

**The split boxes are two boxes with `gap 0`.** IV and counter carry different tones and sit flush against each other; `between iv0,n0 offset 0,1.35` puts the `Enc` box under the middle of the pair instead of guessing it against one of the two. The twelve arrows in the lower half carry neither `@tag` nor `show`: **an edge is only as visible as its two ends**, so each arrives by itself in the step where its second endpoint does.

**The avatars are vector drawings and follow the theme.** `image alice avatar-alice` finds the file in `assets/` exactly as `![](fig-id)` does; an SVG file is spliced in as a nested `<svg>` and inherits `--ink` and `--paper`. The two attack arrows start at `eve.right:0.28` and `:0.72`: the fraction after the colon slides the attachment point along that side, so the two run parallel instead of on top of each other.

The slide is about integrity and authenticity, not confidentiality, and the
text block at the top of the drawing says so, so no caption has to.

`box`, `dot`, `text`, `image`, `zone`, `edge`, `brace`, `container`, `bars`, `grid`, `plot`, `table`, `lanes`, `sequence`, `align`, `spread`, `row`, `col`, `default`, `step` – twenty statements. `-- x` on a `text` draws a short line to what it is about: a leader, not an arrow. An arrow claims a connection, a leader only says what the note refers to.

**Everything in it is measured in grid units, including what carries no label.** The `dot` in the middle has no `r` and so has a *radius* of 0.18 units – 0.36 across – rather than a fixed number of pixels. The difference shows the moment a block changes its `unit=`: a pixel figure would stay where it was while every box around it grew.

**The two rows show two different kinds of even.** In the top row the *gaps between edges* are equal, which a chain of `right of … gap n` already gives you. In the bottom row the *distances between centres* are equal: `spread x` distributes the inner elements between the first and the last, and because the second box is much wider than its neighbours the gaps either side of it are visibly smaller. The arrow at the top left has an endpoint with no object behind it – a coordinate instead of an invisible anchor.

# for its word along its length than across it.
brace whole over r1,r2,r3 side left "the whole thing" pad 0.5 {.turn .muted}
:::

A `container` lays itself around its members and re-fits when they move. A `brace` spans a subset and hangs its label outside. Both measure their distance to their contents with the same word, `pad` – the brace is given `0.62` here so that it comes to lie outside the container's `0.42`.

**Swimlanes are not a `container`, and the reason is what a container does.** A container measures itself against what it holds, so three lanes holding different numbers of things come out different lengths at both ends. A swimlane diagram says the opposite: the bands are equal, and only what happens inside them differs. `lanes` is for that – bands of equal width that want to know nothing about their contents. Part 6 draws one, under *Three roles, one incident*.

**`.turn` applies to every label, not only to a box's.** The left brace reads bottom to top, and the same class does the same thing on a container caption and on an edge label – at all four places where a label is set.

:::

**Two channels that say what a thing is made of: what fills it, and what its
words are set in.** The classes are a closed list rather than free colours –
every fill is mixed from `--emph` and `--ink` over `--paper`, so it survives all
seven themes. The editor's sidebar offers exactly these rows, one slide at a
time, as the next four slides do.

**`.paper` here looks inert and is not.** It is a box's default, but under a
`default box {.tone-3}` a box without the class cannot find its way back, and a
free `text` gets no background without it – that background is what knocks
a line out behind a label. The rule drawn through the row is what tells `.paper`
and `.clear` apart: one knocks the line out, the other lets it through.

:::

**All seven above are one slot, and only one member of it can hold at a time.**
The first two are the corner treatments a rectangle can take, `.round` (the
default) and `.sharp`; the five after them are the outlines that are not
rectangles at all. They share the slot because a hexagon has no corner radius to
argue about, so asking for both would be asking a question with no answer. Each
of the five is drawn from the same four numbers a rectangle would use, joined
into a different path.

**`.turn` reads the label bottom to top**, and it is the box standing apart
at the end – a reading direction, not a shape, so it is in no slot with the
seven. A tall
narrow box has room for a word only along its length, and the alternative is one
letter per line. It applies to every label, not only to a box's – the same class

**Which way an outline aims is the `point` option, not the class name.**
Write `{.chevron} point left`; there is no class `.chevron-left`. `point` applies to `.chevron` and
`.wedge`; on a shape with no point the build refuses it instead of reading past
it.

:::

**`.diamond` is the one outline that eats both axes.** The widest room a diamond
offers is a strip half its width by half its height through the middle, so the
build sizes it at twice what a rectangle would need for the same string, in both
directions – which is why the two above hold the same words at very different
sizes. A sentence in a diamond takes four times the area of the boxes beside it
and swallows the figure; two or three words is the measure, and the explanation
belongs in a note next to it. `.hex` also says *a question is asked here*; the
diamond says on top of that that it goes on in two ways, which most of an audience learned at school.

**A `.cross` with no `w` of its own comes out square, block default or not.** A
plus with arms of two different lengths is not a plus, so a block `default` that
carries a `w` reaches every rectangle in the block and the cross passes it by –
the same exception `bars` makes for outlines. A `w` written on the element's own
line still wins, that being a statement about this one element.

**`.emph`, `.dim` and `.ghost` are one channel written three ways.** They are
classes on an element's own line; they are the verbs a `step` has for them
(`dim a, b`); and on a `bars` line the same three words name column numbers.
Learn one form and you have all three.

**The fourth state – ordinary prominence – has no name.** `{!dim}`
takes the class off instead of adding a fourth word, and that holds for every
class and in every tail. Without the mark there is no way back: a `style` step
could only *add* a class, and many slots spell their base state as the
absence of every member, so a beat could leave such a state and never reach it
again. `p5` is that case drawn – it carries `@prom`, the block gives `@prom` a
`.dim`, and `{!dim}` beside it takes the class away again.

**What is written on the line is in the handout; what is written in a `step` is
not.** Prominence on an
element's own line describes the drawing, prominence in a beat is an act
performed in the talk. Print therefore takes it from the opening beat rather
than the last.

**When type and box do not match, there are three answers**, and the three boxes
above are all three. With no `w` the box grows to the type. With a fixed `w`,
`.shrink` shrinks the type until it fits and `.fit` fills the box in both
directions, bounded to 0.6–1.5× the base size. Text width is *estimated* at
build time – there is no browser – so the size chosen comes out a shade too
small, which is the safe direction.

**The first box overflows on purpose, and the build says so:** `box g1 is 1.2
units wide but its label needs about 1.64`. That is the case to avoid: a fixed `w` too small for the label, and neither `.shrink` nor `.fit`. It is the
one warning this lecture builds with.

:::

**`move` shifts an element, and everything hanging off it goes too.** The proxy gets `move px to between cl,sv`, and because the layout is worked out again at every step, the two dashed arrows still hang off it, the short line on the label still points at it, and the `container` suddenly holds a row instead of two. `hide direct` takes the direct arrow away. `to` names a position and `by` shifts by an amount – and **the build refuses `move @tag to …`**, which would stack the whole set on one point; for a set, `by` is what is meant.

**A beat can also take a class off, and `{!class}` is the only word for it.** A `style` step adds classes, and many slots spell their base state as the absence of every member – ordinary prominence, a solid stroke, the normal type size – so without `{!class}` a beat could leave such a state and never reach it again. The last beat here takes `.dim` and `.emph` off and gives the figure its opening weighting back. **The mark removes the exact name written, not the slot**: `{!dim}` clears no `.ghost`, and a later beat may set `.dim` again.

## free: What a step does not have to say {.wide #motion-implicit}

**Anything hanging off something invisible stays invisible.** So neither the `container` nor the dashed arrows nor the handwritten label needs a `show` of its own: an arrow is only as visible as its ends, a `container` only as visible as its members, and a `text` with a leader only as visible as what it points at. The first step says `show px` and nothing else – the two dashed arrows arrive with the proxy.

**Naming an element overrides that rule, in both directions.** `hide direct` takes the direct arrow away though both its ends are still there; a written `show` does the reverse and brings something on screen whose source is still missing – an outline, say, that should stand around its whole set before the set is assembled (the tree in Part 6, under *Leaves first, and the brackets follow*). Both hold from the beat they are written in onwards. Write one only where the rule says the wrong thing. Write a `show` on every element and you have a figure that stays incomplete the next time one is added: the element is in the block, no step names it, and it never appears.

**`left` and `right` say where a line of words sits, `top` and `bottom` where the block of lines sits.** Both are **measured against the padding rather than the border**: `left` means as far left as this box allows. Without one of the four the label sits centred, which is right for almost every box; the words are there for the rest, above all for a tall box with a short label.

With more than one line **the whole block of lines moves, not the single line**, so on two lines `bottom` puts the *last* one on the inner edge rather than the first. `turn` beats both: a turned label reads bottom to top and is centred on its point whichever way round it goes.

## free: One question across, one question along {.wide #justify-edges}

**A box label and an edge label are two different questions, and only one of them has nine answers.** A box label sits somewhere in a rectangle of space, so there are three answers across and three down. An edge label lies on one side of its line or the other, and that is all. On an edge the choice is therefore the option `side <word>`, not a class, and the build refuses `{.top}` on an edge. Which pair can choose at all is settled only once the line is routed, so naming the other one draws a warning.

::: flip
**`at X,Y` names a point, and `anchor` says which point of the element lands on it.** Nine words, the same nine an edge endpoint spells – `tl` `top` `tr` / `left` `center` `right` / `bl` `bottom` `br` – with `center` the default. It is an option of the *placement*, so it goes directly after it, and it is refused on `right of` / `below`, which name a face rather than a coordinate and answer the same question with `flush`.

**The four alignment classes and `anchor` are one step apart.** `.left` places a run of words inside the element's own box; `anchor left` places the box against the coordinate. A row of labels needs the second, or the first lines up the insides of three boxes that are themselves staggered. For a set, `align x left a, b, c` is the other right answer; `anchor` is for the element with no set to join.

**A `zone` is the frame the two rows stand in: fixed size, name in a corner, painted under everything.** Fixed size is the whole difference from a `container`, which fits its members and is invisible without them – an area is a claim on the paper that holds from beat 0. Being painted first whatever line it is on lets it be declared *after* its contents.

**An area reserves a band, and `in` is how something is placed in it.** The band is the area minus its `pad` on all four sides and minus the caption's own line on the side the caption is on, so `in home` lands on the first paper the caption does not already own – no `+0.45` anywhere. The five words after it name a corner of that band: `left` / `right` across, `top` / `bottom` down, `center` on either. They are words of the placement, not classes, because `.left` on a box already says where its label sits inside its outline.

**`row draft, notes in home center` places the run, not its first box.** The alignment is answered against the extent of everything the row names, which is the one thing no coordinate on a single member's line can state. `home.inner.left` and its five companions are the same six coordinates read off the band, for the placement that wants to be written out.

**`w` and `h` are optional, and an axis nobody writes is the one the contents settle.** `room` is as wide as the widest thing placed in it plus the pad; its height is written, which is what lets `bottom` mean anything. That closes the split with `container`: an area sized by its contents keeps its ground, its caption and its place under everything, and an area with both numbers keeps the fixed size it is given.

**Seven statements expand at parse time into ordinary elements.** `zone` becomes a box and a text; `bars` becomes a box per column (`f-0` … `f-11`), a baseline and – where a second string is written – a text per label; `grid` a cell per field (`g-<column>-<row>`); `plot` a frame with gridlines and axes; `table` a box per cell; `lanes` a band per lane; `sequence` a head, a lifeline, a message and a note per entry. Everything downstream treats the result like any other element: the `brace` spans three columns because three columns are three ordinary boxes, and a `style` step tints three cells because they are boxes. What makes that work is that a coordinate may be another element's – every cell is placed against an edge of the frame the same statement lays. The other four come later: `plot` on *A frame to draw in*, and `table`, `lanes` and `sequence` in Part 6.

**An edge is one of the things a coordinate can be read off.** `w1.cx`, `w1.cy`, `above w1 gap 0.2` – what is read is the wire's bounding box. That counts as soon as a sentence describes the wire rather than one of its ends. Pinned to a box, such a sentence keeps its distance from the box and loses it from the line the moment a fraction or a height changes, with no warning. An edge has no name until you give it one, and the name goes in front, as it does on every other statement: in the slot before the first endpoint, `edge w1 mix -> log`. Staying anonymous costs nothing, the slot being optional. Place in a circle – an element against an edge that itself hangs off it – and you get `placement cycle` with the line number.

**`cell` counts in the height of a grid unit on both axes, exactly as `pad` does.** A `grid` cell is meant to be square, and a number meaning the unit's width across and its height down would give squares only where the unit is itself square.

**The spacing *inside* these statements is `space`, not `gap`.** A placement stands on the same line, and there `gap` means the distance to another element. The distance between two columns is a different thing and takes a different word.

:::

**`series of a` means: the same columns, a second run.** The second `bars` line gets no frame, no baseline and no strip of category names – all three belong to the frame it joins, and writing one anyway is an error. It refuses a placement for the same reason. What it brings is its values, its classes and, like any other `bars` line, the two words that single columns out from the opening picture onwards.

**One word separates the two figures, and it changes the scale.** Without `stacked` the second run stands *beside* the first and a column's cell is shared between them; with `stacked` it stands *on* it, and the scale is no longer the tallest single value but the tallest stack. The same numbers are therefore flatter on the right than on the left, though no value changed. Which reading you want is a question about the content: side by side compares the years, stacked adds them up.

**`key "2023"` names a run, and the chart draws the legend itself** – a swatch that is a column of the run, so it carries the run's colour by construction, and the name beside it. A legend built by hand out of boxes shows a tone at a box's strength, which is not what the columns are filled with.

**`dim 0,1,2` stands on the statement, not in a step.** Q4 is what this is about, and that holds the moment the figure is on screen. Written as a step, the first thing the audience would see is four equal quarters, and the point would arrive on a keypress. It is `dim` on the other three rather than `emph` on the fourth because a column has one channel, its fill, and in a grouped chart the fill already says which run a column belongs to: `emph 3` on both lines paints both Q4 columns in the accent, and the years are gone at exactly the quarter the slide is about. All three prominence words – `emph`, `dim`, `ghost` – take column numbers here, counted from 0, and a number with no column behind it is refused. They are the same three that are classes on an element's line and verbs in a beat.

:::

**`horizontal` turns the columns on their side: the bars run right, the categories stack downwards.** It stands as a single word on the `bars` line, exactly as `stacked` does. The strip of category names becomes a right-aligned column in the left margin, each word set by its own measured width so the right edges form a line, and the baseline stands vertically on the left instead of lying under the bars. The numbers are made up.

**Flat, the proportions are easier to read.** Every bar starts at the same vertical edge, and the eye compares lengths from one shared start line more reliably than heights over a shared floor: on the left you have to visit the tops of the columns in turn, on the right you read the ranking at a glance. A run of bars sorted downwards also looks like a ranking by itself.

**And only flat is there room for the names.** A category called “DNS cache poisoning” cannot be written under an upright column, so the left-hand figure carries numbers, and a reader would need a legend to look them up in, which this figure does not have. The second string is what makes it possible: **a `|` in it splits on that instead of on spaces**, so a label may be as many words as it needs. `|` already separates the cells of a `table` row and the names in a `lanes` list.

  show ngood
:::

**A `plot` is a frame to draw in, not a chart library.** It lays down gridlines, axis labels and the two axis titles, plus a conversion, so that `roc@0.35` names a value in the plot's own units. That is resolved into an ordinary `roc.left+n` only once the block has been read, so a point may name a plot written further down.

**`w` and `h` are counted in grid units, and a grid cell is not square. That is the trap.** On a `150x58` grid a `plot … w 1.9 h 1.5` comes out 285 by 87 pixels: the two numbers are a quarter apart, the picture more than three times. **`aspect W:H` states the proportion the reader actually sees** and lets the build work the missing number out. This ROC curve is therefore written `aspect 1:1` and comes out square, as two axes carrying the same unit should – the chance diagonal runs at 45 degrees, the only slope at which it says what it is called. `4:3`, `1:1` or a single number (that many wide to one tall) are all allowed; `w`, `h` and `aspect` together is an error, because two of the three can contradict each other. The same word and the same rule apply on `bars`.

## free: A curve, and the label beside it {.wide #plot-curves}

**The curves are ordinary edges.** `.smooth` draws the same waypoints as a curve running *through* them instead of as straight segments – an interpolating spline, so a waypoint stays exactly where it was written. The skew warning stays quiet on a curve, its premise not holding: two nearly level points are the shape there rather than two ends that missed each other.

**“weaker” is an edge label *beside* the line, and the ground travels with it.** A fill class on an edge draws a ground behind the label; without a `side top`, `side bottom`, `side left` or `side right` it stays on the line and knocks it out, which is what *The road straight down* does with “yes” and “no”. With one of them it moves clear and takes the ground along. For the name of a curve that is the only choice: on the line it would knock out exactly what it names. The ground still has work to do, because the diagonal and two gridlines run under the curve.

**A label beside a curve has to be short.** The label is moved clear along the normal *at the middle* of the curve, but the curve goes on climbing, so a long label runs back into its own line at both ends instead of staying beside it. Beside a horizontal or vertical edge the question does not arise, and there a label may be as long as it needs to be.

:::

**`same as` on a `plot` or `bars` line copies the whole frame.** The right-hand plot writes no size of its own but points at the left one, so the two figures match to the pixel. Two figures meant to be compared have to be ones the eye can lay over each other; two frames a hair apart cannot do that.

**The copy happens as the line is read, not at layout time – unlike a box's.** Gridlines, axis labels and columns are placed from `w` and `h` the moment the line is read, so a size arriving later would move the frame and leave everything in it standing. **The statement being copied from has to stand above the one copying it**, and the build names what went wrong: a name that appears further down, one pointing at something other than a `plot` or `bars`, or one that is not in the block. `same as` beside `w`, `h` or `aspect` is an error, and so is `same as` on a `series of` line, a series drawing in a frame it does not lay.

**Frames of one size are not yet one scale.** `x` and `y` stand on each `plot` line for themselves, and nothing checks that two frames carry the same ranges – above they are written out twice, and that is the place to re-read before handing the slide over. `bars` has no range to write: every `bars` statement scales to its own highest value, so two frames of one size can hold columns that cannot be compared.

# The language in five lines {#language}

Part 4 showed what each statement draws. This part takes a single line of a
`::: draw` block apart – its six slots, where an element goes, a coordinate
borrowed from another element – and then adds the steps that make a figure
arrive one beat at a time. Five such lines already make a figure: three boxes
and the two arrows between them.

## free: Every line has the same six slots | `kind name label placement options tail` {.full .blocks-left #diagram-slots}

**Every line in a `::: draw` block has the same six slots, in this order**, and most lines fill three or four of them:

```text
box   mix   "Mix"   right of src gap 0.6   w 1.2    {.tone-2 @crypto}
kind  name  label   placement              options  tail
```

**The name is how later lines refer to an element and is never drawn; the label is what the audience reads**, and `""` is a legal empty one. A name is letters, digits, `_` and `-`, and a line starting with `#` is a comment.

**Inside the tail, the first character says what a word is: `.` starts a class and `@` starts a tag.**

- **`.tone-2` is a class**, which says how the element looks. `{!tone-2}`, with an exclamation mark, takes one off again.
- **`@crypto` is a tag**, which says what set the element belongs to.

A tag goes wherever a name goes, so `show @crypto` in a step selects every element that carries it. An element joins a set on its own line, which makes adding one a one-line edit.

## free: Where an element goes | a grid square, a neighbour, or another element's coordinate {.full #diagram-placement}

**Placement is a grid square, or a relation to a neighbour.**

- **`at 2,1`** puts an element in a grid square.
- **`right of mix gap 0.6`** places it against a neighbour, as do `left of`, `above` and `below`.
- **`between a,b`** is the point on the line joining two elements.
- **`offset dx,dy`** is a nudge any of the three accepts on the end.

## free: A coordinate can be another element's | fractions, edges and pictures {.full #diagram-coords}

**A coordinate can be another element's, plus or minus a little** – `at mix.cx,src.cy+0.4`. Anywhere an `X,Y` pair goes, that form goes.

**An anchor can carry a fraction**: `mix.right:0.3` slides the attachment point along that edge, so two arrows between the same pair of boxes run side by side rather than on top of each other. At the end of a placement, `gap 0` makes two boxes touch and `flush left` lines up their left edges.

**An edge is one of the things a coordinate can name.** `text n "only after the handshake" above w1 gap 0.2` sets a phrase against the wire it describes rather than against a box at one end of it, so the label follows its line instead of drifting off it the next time a box changes height. Name the edge first, in the slot before the arrow's first end: `edge w1 mix -> log`. An edge has no name until you write one, and most edges never need one.

**A picture can be an element too.** `image alice avatar-alice w 0.4` finds the file exactly as `![](fig-id)` does, and an SVG drawing takes the theme's colours there in the same way.

## example: What a step block says | four lines at the end of the block {.full #diagram-beats-rule}

**A `step` block is a beat: one forward press, on the same counter a reveal segment uses.** Press forward twice here – a logfile appears, and then the leak into it is emphasised.

:::

**`step leak` shows the logfile, and `step blame` emphasises the leak and the box it runs to.** The words a step knows are `show`, `hide`, `move … to`, `move … by`, the three attention verbs `emph`, `dim` and `ghost`, plus `style` and `label`.

**Anything attached to something invisible is invisible too**, which is why `step leak` names only the logfile. An arrow is only as visible as the two things it joins, a `container` or a `brace` only as visible as its members, and a `text` with a line drawn to something only as visible as what it points at. So showing the boxes shows the arrows between them, and most of a figure needs no `show` of its own.

> note: `print.html` and `print-notes.html` draw the **last** step rather than every step laid over each other, so an element a step hid stays hidden. Emphasis is the exception and comes from the first step, so attention you move around during the talk never reaches the paper while a `{.dim}` written on an element's own line does: written on the line it is part of the drawing, written inside a `step` it is part of the talk.

## free: Words that arrive with a step | `--- from N` pins a beat by number {.full #diagram-beats-pinned}

**A beat is taken in the order it was written, and that is wrong for one shape: a figure that steps in one pane and the words about it in the other.** Written plainly the figure's steps come first and the words queue behind them, because document order is the only order there is. `--- from N` pins a beat to an advance by number instead, so the two halves move together.

:::

**A pinned beat rides one the slide already has rather than adding one**, so this chunk takes two presses, not four. `from 0` is refused – that is the beat the slide opens on, so write the words above the marker – and so is a `from` inside an `::: overlay from N` or a `::: dock from N`, which numbers its own markers already.

> note: The two paragraphs and the two steps are written in different panes. Without `from`, the only way to keep them together is to give the prose no beats at all and let it stand there from the start – which tells the audience the answer before the question.

**The diamond is the outline an audience needs no explanation for.** Most people learned it at school: a question is asked here, and it goes on in two ways. What that costs is room. The widest strip a diamond offers is half its width by half its height, so the build sizes it at twice what a rectangle would need – two or three words, with the explanation in a note beside it, as on the left here. A whole sentence in a diamond would take four times the area of the boxes around it and become the figure.

**The four labels sit *on* the line, and each one says so on its own tail.** A fill class on an edge draws a ground behind the label; with no `side top`, `side bottom`, `side left` or `side right` beside it, the label stays on the line and knocks it out behind itself. That is the right form for a word that *names* the line – “yes”, “no”, a port number, a message type – the way a street sign belongs to the street and the street runs past it either side. A sentence describing what *travels* along the line belongs beside it: *Three roles, one incident* does that, and the ROC curves on *A frame to draw in* take the ground along when they do. Mixing the two in one figure means the audience has to sort each label before it can read any of them, so everything here is on the line.

**The bands are equal, their contents are not, and that is why they are no `container`.** A container measures itself against what it holds, so three bands with different numbers of boxes would come out different lengths at both ends, which is what a swimlane diagram must not show. `lanes` lays the frame, divides it into bands of equal height and writes the names turned on end in front of the left edge; the bands are `.clear` so that everything in them reads over them. It needs no time axis: the reading direction is the axis.

**Every hand-off changes band, and `.elbow` is the routing for it.** The class draws two waypoints itself – a rail across the gap, on the axis the two ends are further apart on – instead of the same double bend written out by hand on every edge. A straight line would do something else: it would run diagonally through a band it never enters, and an audience reads that as involvement.

**The one edge label sits *beside* the line, not on it.** “same sender” describes what travels along the line, and a sentence with a rule through the middle of it is read as two fragments before it is read as a sentence. `side top` lifts it over the line; on a vertical edge it would be `side left` and `side right`, and which pair applies is known only once the edge has been routed – so the wrong pair is a warning at build time rather than an error at parse time. The label is moved clear by what it measures *across* the line: beside a horizontal edge its height, beside a vertical one its width, there with a margin, because a gap across a line of type needs more air than one above it. This label needs no ground: there is nothing but band under it. What a ground does, and how large it may be, is on *A frame to draw in*.

**A tree is built from the leaves.** They are the fixed points, and every level above stands `between` its own children with an `offset` upwards. Written the other way round the compiler copes – it reads the whole block and resolves the dependencies in whatever order works out, not in line order – but the tool you then reach for does not: `align x middle rt, i1, i2` hands the *first* named element's coordinate to the rest, so it would not put the root over its children but stack both children on the root's centre line.

## free: One word draws all six brackets {.wide #tree-elbow}

**Every bracket in that tree is the same word, written six times.** `.elbow` leaves one end on the axis the two are further apart on, runs a rail across the gap and arrives on the same axis; both attachment points are forced onto that axis, whatever the automatic choice would otherwise have taken. The rail is measured between the two elements' *facing edges*, not between their centres, so it lies on one line for both children of an issuer and the pair reads as one bracket rather than as two connectors. By hand that would be twelve waypoints, recomputed every time a level changes its spacing. Put the rail somewhere else with `via`; both on one line is an error. `.elbow` shares a slot with `.smooth`, so a line takes one or the other.

**Its dashed box stands around the whole set before the set is assembled.** It is written into the same beat as the issuers (`show @issuers, scope`), though its other two members arrive a beat later. Without the written `show` the usual rule applies: an outline is only as visible as its members and fits itself to the ones you can see, so it would first have grown around the issuer alone and then opened downwards. Naming it gets you both the visibility *and* the full extent. That is what the exception is for.

**Five rows by three columns is fifteen boxes, each with its own name, width and placement, and a `below` chain to re-aim whenever a row is inserted.** `table` writes them: the heading is one string split on `|`, the data rows are the bare strings under it, `col` gives a width per column and `row` the height of one row. The attribute tail `{.clear .bare .left}` **lands on the cells and not on the frame**, which is what makes a table here a text block rather than a grid of little boxes. The rule under the heading is an ordinary edge between two coordinates, each half from the frame and half from the first cell.

**The first row is a heading, and `unheaded` says it is not.** It takes away exactly the bold: the string is still the row that fixes the column count, its cells are still `t-<col>-0` and `@t-row-0` still names it. Use it for a table of pairs – a key/value block, a legend, a run of definitions. **`row` follows the type size when it is not written**, so a table set in `{.large}` gets rows tall enough for its type.

**Every cell carries two generated tags, `@t-row-N` and `@t-col-N`.** So a row is one beat and a column is one beat, one line of source each – where otherwise every beat would carry three cell names to keep in step with the table by hand. Row 0 is the heading, so count from 1 when you mean data.

**The last beat is the one that reaches the handout.** A figure that lights one row after another and then stops comes out of the printer with its last row glowing, reporting a moment in the talk rather than the table. A fourth beat here takes the emphasis off again and tints the countermeasures column instead – the picture that says something without a talk around it. That it costs a beat is why the prominence verbs need no such thing: prominence a `step` sets is an act in the talk, and print takes its prominence from the opening beat. Prominence on an element's own line describes the drawing, and reaches the handout.

**Protocols come up in lecture after lecture, and written out by hand a protocol is the hardest drawing to change.** Written out, every message carries its own y coordinate: inserting one in the middle means moving everything under it, renumbering all of them and re-guessing how far each lifeline runs – counted on this very figure, thirteen written lines for one inserted message. And a note box taller than the guessed spacing cuts silently into the label beneath it.

**`sequence` therefore owns exactly one thing: the vertical rhythm.** Every entry states how tall it is – a message as tall as its label, a note as tall as its text – and the statement stacks them. A box pushes down what stands under it, and an inserted line is an inserted line. Across, the statement measures itself the same way: all heads are as wide as the widest label, so a row of equal participants does not stand there ragged. `w`, `header` and `space` are overrides you rarely need.

## free: Every part of a sequence keeps a name {.wide #seq-names}

**A message may also name itself, and the name goes in front.** `tunnel c -- s "…"` – in exactly the slot an `edge` carries its name in, before the first endpoint. It is worth doing on the lines something else points at: a generated name like `x-4` counts messages and moves the moment one is added above it, where a written name stays put. Staying anonymous costs nothing, and most messages do.

**Everything else it answers by keeping a name on every part, not by adding words.** Each head keeps the name its `actor` line gives it; each lifeline is `<actor>-life`, each message `wa-N` (counted from 0, so the number drawn is `N+1`), its number `wa-n-N`, its smaller second line `wa-sub-N`, each note `wa-note-N`. Plus tags for the sets: `@wa-msg-N` for one message with its number and second line, `@wa-msgs` for all of them, `@au-msgs` for all that touch the authenticator, `@wa-notes`, `@wa-actors`, `@wa-lives`. The brace and the handwritten annotation on *A protocol down the page* are therefore ordinary lines hung off `wa-3` and `wa-2`, and the statement knows nothing about either.

**There is no `alt` / `else`.** To enclose a group of messages and name it, draw a `container … pad n` around them.

**Four tokens, and none of them is an arrow style of its own.** `->` and `<-` are the same message written from the sender's end and from the receiver's: write the reply as `c <- p` and both lines name the client first, so the source reads as a column instead of zig-zagging. `--` is a line with no head, a relation with no direction, and `<->` carries one at each end – a there-and-back caught in one line. There is no word for “dashed”; `{.dashed}` does that, a message line's attribute tail being an edge's, because a message *is* an edge.

**The token states the head, not a class.** Each of the four sets exactly one of the three states – no head, one, one at each end – so the same thing is never said twice on one line: `{.no-head}` beside a `->` is an error rather than a silent contradiction. Inside a beat the reverse holds, and there the class is the only spelling, because a token cannot be run again.

## free: A self-message, a note, and the air between bands {.wide #seq-entries}

**A self-message is the usual way to put a local action into the sequence**, and it loops out of the lifeline and back in. Its label stands beside the loop, its second line under it. A note between two names sits midway between their lifelines and is as wide as its own text – not as wide as the span, or three words become a banner. It breaks at `\n`, so a note of several lines stays a note.

**`space` on an entry line is the air above that one band.** The tunnel at the foot of *What else a message can be* carries `space 0.9` and stands visibly apart from the setup over it; two or three such gaps break a long exchange into phases an audience can follow. A blank line in the source does not do this: the statement reads through blank lines, so the source may be grouped however it reads best. On an `actor` line `space` is an error, there being no band above the heads.

## free: What a label sits on, and the column of numbers {.wide #seq-labels}

**Every message label brings its own ground.** A lifeline crosses every label a sequence draws, so the ground is drawn from the start and the dashed line is knocked out behind the words. `{.clear}` takes it away, `{.tone-2}` colours it. The smaller second line gets the same ground; the numbers on the left get none, standing outside the frame and crossing nothing.

**`unnumbered` takes the column of numbers away.** It is there otherwise because renumbering by hand is exactly the work the statement removes, and because the number drawn and the index in the tag are the same number: `@x-msg-3` is the arrow numbered 4 on the slide. Where an exchange is short enough that nobody points at a number, the column is just paper.


## figure: A figure that plays itself | `autoplay` and `cycle` {.wide #autoplay}

**`autoplay 1400` walks this figure's beats by itself, and `cycle` starts again at the end.** One delay in milliseconds, the same for every beat. It suits a cover figure that moves while the audience settles, and it works on any slide, as this one shows.

**It calls the same advance the space bar does**, so the speaker window follows through the ordinary sync and the freeze gate applies. `cycle` rewinds through the same counter, so the speaker window follows the rewind too.

**The first keypress, click or scroll on this slide stops it.** The keypress that brought you here counts against the slide you left, not against this one. It does not start on a slide that is already half revealed.

**The delay is between 200 ms and 60 s.** A number outside that range stops the build with an error rather than being clamped.

## closing: The drawing lives in the source | so it is reviewed, diffed and fixed where the words are {#end}

Twenty statements, one inline `<svg>` per figure, and beats that ride the
same counter a reveal does. The figures' labels are text in the source, so a
find-and-replace that renames a thing in the prose renames it in the drawings
too.
