## title: Network Security | thirty-six slides, rebuilt as animated figures {#cover}

Every figure in this lecture is written in the lecture source, laid out at build
time, and stepped with the same key that advances a reveal. The wording of every
label is the wording of the original slide; the arrangement is not.

The rules these were built against are in `figure-design.md`. The tone
assignment holds for the whole deck: `.tone-1` infrastructure, `.tone-2` a
legitimate host, `.tone-3` payload and protocol fields, `.tone-4` whatever this
beat is about, `.accent` the attacker and the attack traffic, `.dim` not
involved in this scene, `.muted` the apparatus.

# Addresses, and the protocols that resolve them

# The boxes are wide enough to carry their own explanation above them, so the
# three labels stand in one row at one gap and every leader is the same short
# vertical. They point at the top edge rather than at the box: a leader to the
# centre would end in the middle of the box's own label.

:::

**A packet carries its own pair of addresses at every layer.** The four boxes are one frame on the wire, and the label above each header says which addresses it carries. Each step emphasises one header and brings its explanation in, outside to inside, in the order a device works through the headers.

> note: How the figure is built: `gap 0` holds the four boxes together as one stack, and the `right of` chain gives all four one size. The payload stays untinted because it plays no part in this figure.

:::

**A name on its own carries no packet.** Two translations sit between what a person types and what a network card can address: DNS turns the name into an IP address, ARP turns the IP address into a MAC address. Both are drawn the same way here, being twice the same construction – a question, an answer, no proof. The last step colours exactly the two protocol names: they are the attack surface, not the addresses. The full explanation is in the video on network fundamentals.

:::

**A switch is an optimisation, not a security measure.** It remembers which MAC address sits behind which port and sends a frame only there; that A does not see B's traffic is a side effect of that thrift. ARP cache poisoning attacks exactly that mapping: A claims, unasked, to hold the MAC address for somebody else's IP, and the traffic lands at A from then on. So the last beat colours A and its wire and takes the emphasis off the normal case again.

**The stage for the next three figures.** The home network on the left, the internet on the right, and a dotted boundary between them that separates rather than connects. B knows two addresses by heart: its default gateway and its provider's DNS resolver. Everything else B has to ask for, and that is where the attacks that follow begin. The break mark on the wire to the web server says there is a lot of network between router and destination that the drawing does not show.

> note: How the figure is built: the boundary is a headless edge between two coordinates and hangs off no element, because it connects nothing.

**The attacker need not break the web server; the answer to the question about it is enough.** A does not wait but hands B a DNS reply of its own – “example.com is 66.9.9.6” – and B dutifully opens the connection to that machine. In the figure the red arrow replaces B's connecting wire: the forged answer comes on the same wire the real one would. The real web server stays reachable and unaware, which is what makes the attack so quiet.

> note: The red arrow takes the wire's place instead of lying beside it, because two lines on top of each other would draw two paths where there is one.

**Sitting on the path means never having to guess.** An attacker on a router or on one of the endpoints sees the query and all its random numbers; they hold the real reply back and push their own in front of it. The figure does that in two moves: first the wire the real answer would come on turns dashed, then the forged arrow takes its place. The box at the top left is the original slide's question to the students, and it is meant seriously: A does not lie on the path to the resolver but can put itself there by ARP cache poisoning.

**From outside, the same attack is suddenly a race.** E does not see the query and has to hit three fields blind: the reply's source IP has to be the resolver's, the UDP destination port on B has to be the query's source port, and the transaction ID has to match the query's. The IP can be forged, the port and the TXID cannot – 2^16 possibilities each, provided the client picks them at random, and some clients did not. On top of that the forged reply has to arrive before the real one, which is why the red arrow replaces the wire the real answer would be travelling on here too. Aim E at the resolver instead of at B and the forged entry lands in its cache and reaches all its customers, which is DNS cache poisoning.

**No botnet, a forged source address instead.** The attacker appears once in the picture, but their traffic carries eight foreign sources – that is the whole trick, and the dashed outlines say nothing about those sources is genuine. The last beat takes the arrows back and puts the countermeasure beside them. It has been known since BCP 38 and is still not deployed everywhere, because it earns the filtering provider nothing.

**The attacker sends little and lets a lot come back.** The small point goes to an open resolver carrying the victim's source address; the large one comes out at the victim, and the ratio of the two areas is the amplification factor. The capture beside it has the numbers. It works only because the servers queried answer anybody who asks.

**Three messages, and the server remembers something after the first.** The block arrows point in the reading direction of their traffic: two to the right, the middle one to the left. The code on the left is the evidence that an ordinary server has to do nothing for this – `s.listen(5)` sets the queue up, and `accept()` only gets the finished connection. That remembered state is the attack surface.

**The state has to live somewhere, so why not in the packet.** The server answers with a sequence number *e* it worked out itself, and gets it back as *e*+1 in the client's ACK. The client carries the state for it, as long as the state fits in 32 bits. A SYN with no ACK behind it then costs the server nothing.

Each link in the chain signs the next, until the server's own certificate stands at the bottom.

**The extensions say what the key is good for.** `Basic Constraints` with `Certificate Authority: NO` forbids this certificate from signing further certificates – were it `YES`, whoever runs `github.com` could issue for every domain in the world. The `Subject Alternative Name` lists the names the certificate is valid for. And `Critical` is not decoration: a client that does not understand an extension marked critical has to reject the certificate.

**sslstrip takes the encryption off the victim without breaking it.** The attacker sits in the path, speaks perfectly ordinary HTTPS to the server, and passes the answer on to the browser in the clear. On the way it rewrites every `https://` in the delivered pages to `http://`, so the browser never has cause to switch. The server sees a faultless TLS connection and the user sees a page with no padlock, which almost nobody looks at.

**The same drawing, two filters more, and they are no longer at the perimeter.** A firewall at the perimeter helps only against whoever is still outside.

**A firewall need not stand in the network; it can run on the machine itself.** There it knows something no device in the network can: which program wants to open the connection. So Little Snitch asks about the application rather than about address and port, and lets the answer be narrowed to a single domain. The price is that somebody has to decide, in the middle of their work.

**A tunnel is a connection travelling inside another connection.** The `ssh` client opens a port locally, accepts an ordinary TCP connection on it, and carries that connection encrypted to the `ssh` server, which lets it out at the far end. Where it comes out is in the command line: at the web server on the same machine, at a third machine in the network behind it, or – with `-D` – at whatever the SOCKS proxy is offered. To every device along the way this looks like a single SSH session.

**If only port 80 stays open, the tunnel becomes HTTP itself.** `htc` accepts the SSH connection locally, wraps it in an ordinary GET request to `vm1.cloud.com` and holds the answer open; `hts` unwraps it at the far end and passes it to the `ssh` server. To the proxy in between this is a long, dull HTTP response with `Content-Length: 102400`. Only somebody looking into the body finds the SSH banner in it.

**The port alone gives nothing away; the first record does.** Run `ssh` on 443 and the first thing it sends is the plaintext banner `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.8p1`, which is unambiguous to a deep packet inspection, and the connection ends at the firewall. The second route speaks real HTTPS instead: a `CONNECT` to the web server, then a regular TLS handshake, with the SSH traffic in ordinary TLS records. The inspection then sees what it sees on any other visit to a website, and only a list of permitted destinations still helps.

**Proactive measures build a wall, and the wall has joints.** Firewalls, cryptography, security updates, penetration tests and access control keep the normal case out, each of them a stone in the same wall. The intruder does not go round that wall but through one of its joints, and from that moment no prevention helps any more. What still carries is the reactive measures: logs that record the incident, an incident management that works through it, and between them the IDS that noticed it at all.

**Pointwise against areal – the whole difference hangs on that.** A misuse detector knows signatures of known attacks: single points in the set of all intrusions, and anything beside them raises no alarm. An anomaly detector knows an area instead – a model of permitted operation – and reports everything outside it. So only the second can report an attack nobody has seen before, and that is also why it reports harmless events its model does not cover.

**A packet brings its own character distribution with it.** Above is what was actually counted in the payload; below, the same count lies over what is normal for this service. The red needles stand where the observed packet is far above the reference – the eye sees the outlier before any figure has been computed. Which leaves the question the original asks: what distance measure turns this picture into a number?

**The training phase measures what is normal.** The sensor counts the characters in the payload of harmless requests, sorts them descending and groups neighbouring characters into bins – “group multiple features into bins of suitable size (aggregating counts)”. What it keeps is not the individual frequencies but the bin shares $p_1 = 0.20$, $p_2 = 0.18$, $p_3 = 0.12$ with $\sum_i p_i = 1$. The method is from C. Krügel et al. (2002), *Service Specific Anomaly Detection for Network Intrusion Detection*, SAC 2002, ACM, pp. 201–208.

**At run time the same division is counted again.** Every request yields observed bin frequencies $O_i$; the expected ones follow from the trained shares, for instance $E(\text{Bin 1}) = 0.2 \cdot 163 = 32.6$. The distance between observed and expected is the chi-squared statistic

$$\chi^2 = \sum_i \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$

and the sensor raises an alarm as soon as $\chi^2 > t$. What value $t$ should take is what the next slide decides.

**The four cells are a count, not a vocabulary.** Ten labelled packets run through the sensor, lined up by the anomaly score it gives them; $t$ is the rule on that axis, and everything right of it is reported as an alarm. With $t$ in the middle the sensor catches three of the four attacks (TP) and misses one (FN), and wrongly reports two of the six harmless packets (FP) – the two figures the rest of the chapter rests on: TP rate 0.75 and FP rate 0.33. Push $t$ right and the sensor stays quiet more often and both rates fall (0.50 and 0.00); push it left and both rise (1.00 and 0.67). No value of $t$ lowers one without taking the other with it.

**A ROC curve is every threshold at once.** Each point on the curve belongs to a value of $t$: the share of false alarms across, the share of detected attacks down. A strict threshold keeps the false alarms small and finds only half the attacks; a generous one finds nearly everything and lets every second harmless flow through as an alarm. You can choose between the two, but not have both.

**Compare two methods by their curves, not at one point.** The further a curve bulges into the top left corner, the better the method separates – the corner itself would be perfect, the diagonal is guessing. Alternative binnings of the character distribution give exactly such families of curves, and the better binning is the one with the upper curve. Which point on the chosen curve to set is a question the picture does not answer.

**The same arithmetic, a test instead of a sensor.** Of 96 people eight are ill; the test catches seven of them and misses one, and at the same time reports eleven of the 88 healthy ones as positive. Anyone holding a positive result is therefore one of 18 positives, of whom only seven are really ill: the probability is $7/18 \approx 39\,\%$, not the 87.5 % of the hit rate. A sensor with a good TP rate behaves exactly this way in a network where nearly all the traffic is harmless.
