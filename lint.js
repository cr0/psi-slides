/**
 * Lecture linter – static checks for source.md files.
 *
 * Zero-dep – nothing from node_modules – so it runs as a pre-commit gate
 * without the Markdown/Shiki stack, and independent of build.js so the two
 * can evolve without sharing state. It re-states the parser's ground truth
 * rather than importing it: VALID_TAGS (the chunk types), fence-aware reveal
 * splits, ::: directives.
 *
 * Two exceptions. The diagram vocabulary comes from diagram-core.mjs: that
 * module is pure JS with no dependencies of its own, so importing its
 * *tables* costs this file nothing it was protecting, and it removes
 * thirteen copies that had to change in two files in one commit. The rule
 * there: tables only. A function would pull the whole compiler in behind it.
 * The {…} tail grammar and the ::: draw opener come from tails.mjs, which is
 * the same kind of file - zero dependencies, tables plus a few pure parsing
 * and formatting helpers, nothing behind it - so build.js and this file read
 * every tail through one parser and cannot disagree about one.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node lint.js <source.md>
 *   node lint.js lectures/
 *   node lint.js lectures/ --strict     # warnings become exit 2
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  clean (or warnings without --strict)
 *   1  one or more errors
 *   2  --strict and at least one warning
 *
 * Per-file override anywhere in the source, for warnings only – an error is
 * a deck the build refuses and is reported whatever the comment says:
 *   <!-- linter: ignore reveal-overuse, density -->

// The diagram vocabulary is *imported*, not mirrored. Thirteen tables used to
// be written out again here and had to change in two files in one commit;
// diagram-core.mjs is pure JS with zero dependencies of its own, so importing
// them costs this file nothing it was protecting.
//
// The rule that still holds: **import only the tables.** A function from that
// module would pull the whole compiler in behind it, and lint.js stays
// runnable without the Markdown/Shiki stack precisely because it does not.
//
// The dg*Name helpers bend that rule, and they are still a table: what
// `bars`, `grid`, `table` and `lanes` call the elements they expand into,
// indexed rather than listed. This file has to agree with the compiler
// exactly – a `brace over f-0,f-1,f-2` names elements no line declares –
// and writing the scheme out twice is the duplication importing the tables
// was meant to end. `rejectClassOn` and its siblings ride the same bend
// for the same reason: they ARE the rule for which class may sit on which
// kind, and a second spelling of it here is how this gate came to pass
// lines the build refuses – lectures/network-security is linted by CI but
// never built, so such a line merged green and failed every later build.
// All of them are one-liners over the tables, with nothing behind them.
//
// `dgTakes` rides the same bend, and for the sharpest version of the same
// reason: it is one function over DG_KIND_OPTS plus a table of the forms
// that have no keyword to list, and its whole purpose is that the compiler
// and this gate cannot print two different accounts of what a statement
// accepts. Restating it here would be the drift it exists to prevent.

// ── the collapsed view's bold audit ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// In topic-bold mode the projection shows the first sentence of every
// paragraph plus, out of the rest, only the <strong> runs: splitSentencesIn
// wraps the continuation's *text* nodes in .prose and deliberately does not
// descend into STRONG, so the collapse CSS hides the words around a bold and
// leaves the bold standing. A one-word bold in continuation prose therefore
// reaches the room as a bare noun with no sentence attached – the tutorial
// shipped `a **marginalia** – an aside …`, and the slide read `– marginalia`.
//
// The rule is the authoring skill's ("Single-word bolds in continuation",
// reference/style.md); this is the mechanical half of it. A **warning**, and
// never an error: build.js renders such a bold perfectly happily, and a
// linter stricter than the build fails a source that builds clean. Two words
// is the threshold because the honest fix is always to widen the bold into a
// phrase that stands alone, and a two-word bold almost never does.
//
// Mirrors build.js's three sentence helpers rather than importing them –
// they live inside the AUDIENCE_JS template literal, which is a string, not
// an export. Keep them congruent: a linter that disagrees with the build
// about where the first sentence ends reports on the wrong half of a
// paragraph. (Backslashes are single here and doubled there for that reason.)
