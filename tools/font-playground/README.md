# Typeface playground

The generator behind **`docs/site/display-faces.html`**, the project site's
typefaces page. It has two sections:

- **the text faces** – the nine serif, sans and mono faces of `BUNDLED_FONTS`,
  drawn into one mock slide and one mock page of the handout, with a control
  per role, the `F` key's reading face, and a card per face;
- **the display faces** – a cover and a section divider in each face of the
  **display role**, the typeface a `cover:`, a `closing:` and a `section:`
  slide use for their headline, and that nothing else in the deck touches.

The file keeps the name it had when it held the display faces alone, because
links to it exist.

```bash
node tools/font-playground/build-playground.mjs          # write the page
node tools/font-playground/build-playground.mjs --check  # report drift, write nothing
open docs/site/display-faces.html

cd tools/font-playground && npm install                  # only for the next roster
node measure-scale.mjs                                   # re-measure the size correction (needs Chrome)
```

32 display faces, **OFL-1.1 only**, in three flavours: 6 hand, 8 machine, 18
graphic (8 serif, 10 sans).

## The text faces

Read out of `build.js` by `text-roster.mjs`, the file `measure-xheight.mjs` and
the `xheight` gate already use, so a face added to `BUNDLED_FONTS` appears on
the page at the next run and `--check` reports the tracked page stale until
then. The defaults come from `BUNDLED_DEFAULTS` and the inline-code ratio from
`CODE_XHEIGHT_RATIO`, by the same kind of text match. What the generator adds
by hand is `TEXT_NOTES`, one line per face; a face without one gets an empty
line and a warning.

Each face is declared the way `fontStyleTag` declares it: the same files,
`font-weight: 100 900`, `font-display: block`, the named instance in the
descriptor. **Three files are also the site's own type** – IBM Plex Sans
upright and italic and JetBrains Mono upright in `docs/site/fonts/` – and those
are referenced by URL instead of embedded a second time, after a byte
comparison with the package; a mismatch makes the page embed the package's
bytes. The KB on a card is upright plus italic as the package ships them, which
is what the build reports as the cost per view.

The mocks follow the engine's numbers rather than a likeness of them: the
slide is the 1600 × 900 frame with the body at `1rem × --zoom`, the bold look
is `style: {bold: plain}` with the stress mark, the page is print's 10pt column
with `print-bold: bold`; `F` moves the reading face on the slide only, with the
`--bold-weight`, the mono leading and the per-face inline-code size that
`codeTag` emits.

## The page is tracked, and that is why there is a `--check`

`docs/site/display-faces.html` is generated and committed, the arrangement
`docs/artifact/figures-you-write.html` already has: nobody edits the HTML, and
`--check` fails when it no longer matches a fresh build. `pages.yml` runs it
before assembling the site, beside `refresh-figures.mjs --check` – a staleness
gate nothing runs is a comment. **Edit `roster.mjs` or `scales.json`, then
regenerate and commit the page in the same change** – and the same holds for a
change to the text half of `BUNDLED_FONTS`, `BUNDLED_DEFAULTS` or
`CODE_XHEIGHT_RATIO` in `build.js`, which the page reads too.

There used to be a second, local `font-playground.html` beside this file with
the same specimens in a plain shell. Two near-identical pages is a duplication
with no reader, so there is one now and it is the published one.

## Where the faces are read from

The engine's own `node_modules` first: all 32 are dependencies of the root
package, so `--check` has everything it needs after a plain `npm ci`, which is
the only install the workflow does. This package's own tree is the fallback, for
a candidate the engine does not carry yet.

## Why it is its own package

Thirty-odd candidate faces were an exploration, not a dependency of the engine.
Keeping them here meant `npm install` at the root stayed untouched while the
roster was being decided. `desktop/` is the same arrangement for the same
reason. *(The faces that survived are now engine dependencies as well; this
package is what the next revision of the roster is done in.)*

## Why every face is embedded

The page inlines each candidate as one latin `woff2`, base64, in an
`@font-face` – exactly what the build does. A page that linked Google's CDN
would be showing a face the built HTML would not have, and would hide the
number that decides half of these candidates: **the KB on each card is what a
deck naming that face carries in every view.** The body type behind the
headlines is the deck's own Literata, read out of the engine's `node_modules`,
and the site's own IBM Plex Sans, which is the same Fontsource cut and is
already loaded from `docs/site/fonts/` – so what is compared is the pairing
rather than the face alone, without a second copy of a face the reader has.

## What the specimens do that the first playground did not

Both are the engine's behaviour rather than a preference, and a page claiming
to show what a deck would look like has to do what the build does:

- **The measured number rides as a `size-adjust` descriptor on the
  `@font-face`,** not as a multiplier on a `font-size`. That is how it reaches
  every cover composition, print, the zoom and `auto-fit` in the engine without
  any of them knowing about it – see `fontStyleTag` in `build.js`. The
  line-height *is* multiplied by it, because `size-adjust` scales the glyphs and
  the face's own metrics while a numeric line-height resolves against the
  nominal size and does not follow (`DISPLAY_LH`).
- **The tracking is reset to `normal`.** A cover sets a negative
  `letter-spacing` tuned for the body serif, and a condensed display face came
  out with its letters touching; `DISPLAY_TRACK` in `build.js` is the list of
  every rule that had to be reset. A specimen page that quietly put it back
  would be showing a defect that has been fixed.

## The three fields `roster.mjs` decides

Family, licence, attribution and subsets are read from each package's
`metadata.json`. What the roster decides is what a package cannot answer:

**`file`** – which file of the package is the one face to embed. A variable
family ships one per axis set (Fraunces had six) and only one is the axis a
title line varies on.

**`flavour` and `kind` are two fields, and Chakra Petch is why.** Flavour is
what a face looks like and it sorts the page; kind is what a face *is* and it
drives one rule – a display serif over a serif body reads as one typeface set
badly rather than as two. Chakra Petch is a machine to look at and a sans to
pair with. The playground draws each candidate over its paired body face, so
the rule is visible rather than asserted, and `lint.js` warns on
`display-pairing` when a deck does the opposite.

**`scale`** – a measured multiplier, from `measure-scale.mjs`: the advance
width of a real German title against Literata's, clamped to [0.55, 1.45].
These faces disagree about width by a factor of three – Press Start 2P is
2.10× Literata, Amatic SC 0.62× – and the cover's type size is tuned for the
body serif, so without the correction a headline simply ran off the slide.
In the engine the number rides as a `size-adjust` descriptor on the
`@font-face` rather than as a multiplier on a font-size, so it reaches all ten
cover compositions, print, the zoom and `auto-fit` without any of them knowing
about it. Re-measure when a face is added: a number nobody measured is a
number that silently overflows a slide, which is the same discipline
`dgCharW` in `diagram-core.mjs` is held to.

## What the page checks that an eye cannot

Each card carries a **`no <chars>` badge** for the German characters the face
lacks. The probe was wrong twice before it was right, and both mistakes are
worth knowing because both look like success:

1. **Measuring before the faces load.** A face the page has not finished
   loading measures as its fallback, so the first cut reported all 26 then-
   candidates as having no umlauts while the page plainly drew *Wer hört*.
   `document.fonts.ready` alone does not cover a family used only in canvas;
   each family has to be asked for by name with `document.fonts.load()`.
2. **Comparing against one fallback.** Equal widths were read as a miss, which
   flagged Pixelify Sans – whose advance happens to equal the fallback
   monospace's. The fix is two fallbacks of different widths: a glyph the
   candidate has is drawn by the candidate either way and the widths agree; a
   glyph it lacks is drawn by whichever fallback is behind it, and they do not.

The one real finding, confirmed against a rendered specimen rather than trusted
from the probe: **Rubik Mono One has no eszett**, and draws it from the
fallback mid-word. It also draws lowercase as capitals.

*The method's limit, since it is not obvious: it cannot see a missing CJK
glyph, because both generic fallbacks resolve CJK through the same system
font. For the latin characters this page asks about, they differ.*

## The controls

The text section has five rows of buttons: one face per role, the reading face
(`slide text · F`, the three words `font:` takes) and `slide` / `page`. The line
under them prints the frontmatter that choice needs and its KB per view. The
display section's controls:

| control | what it answers |
| --- | --- |
| the four text fields | does it hold *my* title, not a specimen's |
| `both` / `cover` / `divider` | one slide across the whole card, for a close look |
| `hand` / `machine` / `graphic` | the three flavours the brief named |
| `dark ground` | the divider is where a deck most often goes dark |
| `caps` | several of these faces only work set in capitals |
| `wide cards` | one card to the frame, for the long titles |
| headline size, tracking | a face that needs tracking is not a face that has it |
| weight | variable candidates only, and now really only them |

Click any slide to enlarge it, Escape to close. The slides are sized in `cqw`
inside a container query, so a card and the blown-up stage are one slide at two
sizes – a display face judged at one size is not judged.

*The weight slider reaches the variable faces alone, which the first version
only claimed: a static cut asked for a weight it does not have gets a
browser-synthesised bold, and a synthesised bold is a specimen of the browser
rather than of the typeface. Each card opens at the weight a headline is really
set in – the top of a variable range, the single cut otherwise.*

## What was cut, and why

- **Apache-2.0** – Permanent Marker, Rock Salt, Just Another Hand. Not because
  the licence forbids embedding; it does not. Because `bundledFaces()` emits
  OFL text with the faces, and a second licence regime in that path buys one
  typeface at the price of a special case. Caveat Brush is the loud marker
  instead.
- **Playfair Display, Fraunces, Major Mono Display** – the author's call.
  DM Serif Display, Prata, Young Serif and Yeseva One took the serif slots.
