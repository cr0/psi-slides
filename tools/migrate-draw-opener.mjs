/*
 * Rewrite the old `::: draw {unit=WxH autoplay=N cycle}` opener to the
 * braceless form `::: draw WxH autoplay N cycle`, everywhere in a repository
 * that is neither generated nor history.
 *
 *   node tools/migrate-draw-opener.mjs <repo-root>            dry run: list what would change
 *   node tools/migrate-draw-opener.mjs <repo-root> --write    rewrite in place
 *   node tools/migrate-draw-opener.mjs <repo-root> --check    exit 1 if anything would change
 *
 * The transform replaces the whole matched opener rather than substituting
 * tokens in place: the old tail is parsed into its fields (`parseLegacyDrawTail`)
 * and the new line is produced by the one formatter build.js also uses
 * (`formatDrawOpener`), so the migration and the build cannot disagree about
 * the canonical spelling. A tail the parser does not fully understand - an
 * unknown token, a `#id` (draw ids were diagnostic only and are no longer
 * supported), a `cycle` with no autoplay, a delay out of range - stops the
 * run before anything is written, and names every such line.
 *
 * The match is anywhere in a file, not only at a line start: that is what
 * catches the executable template in docs/site/shoot-gallery.mjs, the sources
 * built inside tests, and prose in the skills. Which is also why the
 * exclusions matter - the built views and the two spliced figure pages are
 * rebuilt by the build and by refresh-figures.mjs, and the history files
 * explain the old form on purpose. Write and check share one exclusion set.
 *
 * `--check` is the cross-repository acceptance check, run once per
 * repository by hand. It reports every file the write mode would change, and
 * every old-form token (`LEGACY_TOKENS`) left on an *active authoring
 * surface* (`isActiveSurface`) - a lecture source, a skill, a site page, the
 * root documents an author reads - where a symbolic `unit=WxH` in prose is
 * as stale as a real opener. The committed gate
 * (test/gates/legacy-draw-syntax.mjs) imports both definitions and covers
 * this checkout alone, because a gate has to work from a bare clone; this
 * mode is what covers the sibling content repository.
