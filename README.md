# psi-slides

psi-slides turns one Markdown file into four HTML files: the projection for the room, a presenter cockpit for your own screen, a reading document, and a handout with the spoken notes folded in.

The problem it solves is drift. Most lecturers keep slides and a script as two documents, and after two semesters they disagree with each other. psi-slides makes them one text: the prose you write is the handout, and the *same* prose – abridged by a rule you control – is what the projector shows. Nothing is written twice, so nothing can fall out of sync.

psi-slides is a build script. `node build.js source.md` writes four HTML files next to your source, and each of them carries everything it needs: the styling, the scripts, the images, the typeset maths, and the typefaces – three families ship with the tool and are embedded in each output, so a lecture looks the same on a machine that has none of them installed. Nothing is fetched at run time, from anywhere; open one in a browser with the network unplugged and it is complete. There is no server and no cloud account, and nothing has to be installed on the lectern machine. To give the audience the slides, or the full manuscript, you send them one file.

psi-slides has already carried a full semester of university teaching. Read [When *not* to use this](#when-not-to-use-this) before you invest in it.

## A confession from this fork

psi-slides has a short list of things it does not do, and it means them. The [PRD](PRD.md) says *no gratuitous ornament … no drop shadows beyond hairlines*. The [figure guide](figure-design.md) says *no shadows, no free colours*. Both come with reasons, and the reasons are good.

This fork broke both rules. On purpose, knowingly, with a corporate design manual open on the other monitor.

Cards here come in four colours. Boxes cast a hard 45-degree shadow in a darker shade of themselves, the kind a slide master from 2009 would recognise and nod at. Figures got the same treatment, because once the cards had shadows the boxes looked lonely. There is also a section divider covered in pastel circles. We know.

In our defence: all of it is off until a deck asks for it (`style: {elevation: offset}`, `palette:`, `section: poster`). A lecture that says nothing still builds byte for byte what it always did, so the principles stay the default, where they belong. The shadows print. The colours pass the contrast checks, mostly, and the build says so when they don't. And the whole thing exists because a lecturer who teaches in a room full of one orange wanted slides that look like they belong there.

If you came for psi-slides as designed, quiet and typographic with one accent, use upstream: [UBA-PSI/psi-slides](https://github.com/UBA-PSI/psi-slides). If you came for the colouring book, welcome. Please don't tell the PRD.

Five lectures are published there, each in all four views. Walk one with the space bar, press `S` for the cockpit and `O` for the overview board, and read the handout the same source produced &ndash; before installing anything.

## What it looks like

The core idea in two pictures. A *chunk* is the unit psi-slides works in – roughly one slide's worth of text – and the two pictures below are one chunk rendered twice from the same source. `C` toggles between the collapsed view, which is what the projector shows, and the full manuscript text.

| Collapsed – what the projector shows | Full – the same chunk, unabridged |
| --- | --- |
| ![Audience view with collapse on: heading, topic sentence, and one promoted bold fragment](docs/img/audience-collapsed.png) | ![The same chunk with collapse off: every paragraph in full](docs/img/audience-full.png) |

You did not author two versions. You wrote the right-hand text and marked which fragments matter; the left-hand slide is derived from it.

**The presenter cockpit** (`S` opens it from the audience view). Column scrubber on top, a mirror of the projector, your private notes below, upcoming chunks down the right edge. Both windows stay in step: which slide is up, how much of it is uncovered, zoom, theme, figure focus, laser pointer.

![Speaker cockpit showing the scrubber, stage mirror, notes pane and preview strip](docs/img/speaker.png)

**The overview board** (`O`), borrowed from *Prezi*: zoom out to the whole lecture at once, drag to pan, `/` to search, `Enter` to land. In a lecture you did not write yourself, the board is where you get oriented – the typographic rhythm of principles, examples and figures is visible at a glance.

![Overview board showing three columns of chunks with one selected](docs/img/audience-overview.png)

**The handout** (`print-notes.html`). The document version of the same lecture with every `> note:` rendered as an aside – “what was on the slide, plus what the lecturer said”, in one PDF-able page flow. There is also a plain `print.html` without the notes, for students.

## Quickstart

There are two ways in. **If you would rather not open a terminal**, take the
desktop builder from the
[releases page](https://github.com/UBA-PSI/psi-slides/releases): a window that
you point at a `source.md` and leave open beside your editor, building the
four views again on every save. It is part of every release, it carries that
release's engine inside it, and nothing about it leaves your computer.
macOS has been tried on a real machine; the Windows and Linux packages are
built by CI and are experimental, so a report of what breaks is welcome.
`desktop/README.md` has the details.

**The command line** is the other way, and it is what CI and this repository
use. It requires Node 22 or newer. Nothing else: no LaTeX, no Pandoc, no
server, nothing installed globally.

```bash
# the latest release, unpacked into psi-slides/
curl -L https://github.com/UBA-PSI/psi-slides/releases/latest/download/psi-slides.tar.gz \
  | tar xz
cd psi-slides

npm install

node build.js lectures/tutorial/source.md
open lectures/tutorial/audience.html      # macOS; use xdg-open or your browser otherwise
```

On Windows take the `.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/UBA-PSI/psi-slides/releases). Both the release archive and a `git clone` include example lectures already built, so you can open one before running anything. A clone follows current development; the tagged archive does not.

That builds the self-referential tour: a lecture that teaches the basics of the tool *by being the tool*, and hands over to `lectures/diagrams/` for figures and `lectures/decoration/` for the frame, type and colour. Press `?` for the cheat sheet, `S` to open the cockpit, `O` for the overview, `C` for collapse. Its source, [`lectures/tutorial/source.md`](lectures/tutorial/source.md), is the authoring reference.

Start your own:

```bash
node build.js --new my-lecture          # scaffold lectures/my-lecture/source.md
node build.js --new my-lecture --into ~/talks   # …or scaffold it somewhere else
node build.js lectures/my-lecture/source.md --watch   # live reload on every save
node lint.js lectures/my-lecture/source.md            # static checks
```

`--watch` reloads every open tab on every save, so you can keep your text editor, the audience view and the cockpit visible at once.

## The four views

All four come from one `source.md` and are written next to it.

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `audience.html` | The projection. One chunk on the stage, camera pans between them, collapse on by default. |
| `speaker.html` | The cockpit. Opens from the audience view with `S`; the two windows then keep each other in step directly, with no server in between. |
| `print.html` | A reading document with a cover and a table of contents. All reveals shown, all expansions inlined. |
| `print-notes.html` | The same document with `> note:` blocks folded in under their chunk. |

Each is a single file. Mail one to a colleague as an attachment and it works.

There is a fifth output that is not a view: `node build.js <source.md> --slides-pdf`
drives the audience view through every presentation state in a headless Chromium
and prints `slides.pdf`, one page per state. It is the fallback for a room where
the HTML will not run, and a classic deck you can hand on. It does not replace
the two print views – those are documents, this is slides. The documents have
PDF flags of their own: `--print-pdf` writes `print.pdf` and `--print-notes-pdf`
writes `print-notes.pdf`, on A4 with the print view's own margins and page
numbers. Any of the three combine and start the browser once.

## How you write

A lecture is columns of chunks. A column is a `#` heading; a chunk is a `##` heading with a type, and its body is ordinary Markdown.

```markdown
---
title: Anonymous Communication
presenter: Dominik Herrmann
course: advasp
---

# Why mixes need a crowd {#crowd}

## principle: Anonymity is a property of the set | not of the channel {.wide #anon-set}

**Anonymity comes from the others doing the same thing.** A mix node that
forwards exactly one message leaks it by timing alone.

The size of the anonymity set is therefore a property of the **traffic**, not
of the protocol.

> note: Ask the room for the smallest set they would trust. Answers cluster
> around 100 and the reasoning is always worth two minutes.
```

The grammar is `## type: Heading | Sub-heading {.width #id}`. Ten types (`title`, `closing`, `outline`, `principle`, `definition`, `example`, `question`, `figure`, `exercise`, `free`) set the visual treatment and a word budget the linter enforces; four widths (`narrow`, `standard`, `wide`, `full`) set how much stage the chunk takes. Adding `{.bare}` to the same braces keeps a heading in the document, the contents page and the search index and takes it off the projection – for the talk that is a run of figures and still needs a name per slide.

**What lands on the slide** is decided per chunk, by one of two mechanisms:

- **Derived** (the default): the first sentence of every paragraph, plus any `**bold**` fragments. It imposes a discipline: every paragraph has to open with a claim that stands on its own. Bold selects rather than stresses – a promoted phrase is set plain by default, and `*em*` inside it stresses one word.
- **Stated**: a `::: slide` block *is* the screen, everything else is narration. Or `::: script`, the other way round: the chunk is the screen and only the marked block is narration. Reach for these when the argument wants continuous prose that no first-sentence rule can carve up.

Everything else is body-level directives: `---` on its own line splits a chunk into **reveal segments**; `::: expand <label>` hides detail behind a chevron; `::: cols 2`, `::: side 2:1` and `::: flip` shape internal layout; `::: cards 3` and `::: rows` lay items out as containers rather than as a text flow, so an item is whole or it is nowhere; `::: footnote` and `::: marginalia` place asides; `![](fig-id)` resolves against `assets/`; `$inline$` and `$$display$$` are **math**, rendered by KaTeX during the build. Sixteen directives in all; the tutorial, [`lectures/diagrams/`](lectures/diagrams/) and [`lectures/decoration/`](lectures/decoration/) show them live, `::: dock` among them in the last.

**A slide can carry more than a text column.** `::: backdrop <ref>` puts a picture behind the whole slide, edge to edge, and `::: overlay` lays a block of type over it. Both are written at chunk level rather than inside the body, because the text column cannot reach the edges of the slide. A backdrop's *window* can walk the reveal beats – `reveal full, right 45%` retreats the picture to free the paper the title is written on, and adding `over` to the same `{...}` makes the same list, run the other way, grow the picture over the title until it covers it. `::: overlay {…} from 1` is the counterpart for the words. An overlay with `.panel` grows to the frame – a column the full height, a band the full width, or the whole frame veiled – which is how a photograph gets a text area set off from it. `::: dock` is the same vocabulary with the other contract: it is part of the frame and the text column yields to it, a running table of contents beside every slide of a part (`.every` under the `#` heading, with the live item lit), a line that stays under the words, a remark that arrives on a beat into a track kept free for it. A `---` inside any of these blocks is a beat on the slide's own counter.

**`cover:` picks one of ten opening compositions**, ordered quiet to loud: the type in the lower-left third; a nameplate over a lede; a block centred on both axes; a title set to fill the slide; a full field of the accent colour; a claim the talk opens on; a photograph run off one edge or filling the frame; and the title chunk's own `::: draw` figure set beside the title or above it. `## closing:` draws the same composition at the end with the author's own words, so the lecture closes on the shape it opened with. `section:` gives a column's divider six treatments, every one quieter than the cover – including a **running agenda** that lists every part and marks the live one. A divider can also carry its own slide: the lines between a `#` heading and the first chunk are a quotation, a photograph or a figure, whichever the author writes there. On the running agenda those lines are usually a keyword line for the part, and `section-caption: item` sets them under the live item instead of under the whole list – where, under the last entry, they read as the last part's. [`lectures/decoration/`](lectures/decoration/) shows all of it in one lecture.

**Figures are written, not drawn.** `::: draw` is a small boxes-and-arrows language compiled to inline SVG at build time: elements are named and placed against one another rather than on a canvas, arrows stay attached to boxes that move, and a figure's steps advance on the same key the reveal segments do. Some statements write those boxes, texts and edges for you: a column chart, a repeated cell grid, a cartesian frame, a table of labelled cells, a set of swimlanes, and `sequence`, which draws a protocol down the page &ndash; one lifeline per actor, numbered messages between them, notes and self-messages. Every part `sequence` draws keeps a name, so hanging an annotation off one message is an ordinary line of source rather than something `sequence` has to support. [`figure-design.md`](figure-design.md) is how to lay one out and [`docs/artifact/`](docs/artifact/) teaches the language from nothing.

**Typefaces travel with the file.** Three families ship in any one output, and which three is a per-lecture decision: Literata, Source Serif 4, Bitter, Noto Serif or Roboto Serif for the serif, IBM Plex Sans or Inter Tight for the sans, JetBrains Mono or Noto Sans Mono Condensed for the monospace – all under the SIL Open Font License, which permits exactly this. Naming one of them in the `fonts:` block needs no file of your own. `ligatures:` decides separately what a listing does with `->` and `!=`: `text` keeps the ordinary fi and fl in prose and leaves code alone (the default), `all` puts the code ligatures back, `none` removes both. Safari does not expose locally installed fonts to a page at all, as an anti-fingerprinting measure, so a lecture that merely *names* its typefaces falls back to Georgia and the system sans there whatever the reader has installed. The bundle costs about 280 KB per file; `fonts: none` in the frontmatter turns it off.

**The transition slides can have a face of their own.** `fonts: {display: Anton}` names a fourth role, and it reaches the cover, the closing slide and the section dividers and nothing else: an ordinary chunk heading, a card, a figure label all keep the body type. Those three slides are the one place in a deck where a loud typeface is not a mistake, because nobody reads a divider, they see that one has arrived. Thirty-two faces ship for it, all under the SIL Open Font License, in three flavours – handwritten, pixel grids and terminals, and poster type. Each carries a size correction measured against the body serif, because these faces differ in width by a factor of three and without it the condensed ones look timid and the wide ones run off the slide; `style: {display-scale: 1.4}` is there for when the face is right and the size is not. A deck that names no display face embeds nothing and builds exactly as before. Neither of the reader's keys can disturb it: `F` cycles the body face and `A` the accent theme, and the cover and the dividers ignore both, though their colour still follows the theme so they stay readable in dark. `lectures/display-face/` is a short deck that shows it.

To use your own instead, drop the files into `fonts/` beside your source and name the families:

```yaml
fonts:
  serif: Literata
  sans: IBM Plex Sans
  mono: JetBrains Mono
```

Files are matched by name, with weight and style read off the suffix (`Literata-Bold.woff2`, `Literata-600italic.woff2`, `Literata[wght].woff2`). `.woff2`, `.woff`, `.ttf` and `.otf` all work; woff2 is much the smallest. A role you name uses your font, a role you leave out keeps the bundled one, and naming a family with no matching file fails the build rather than falling back quietly.

> **Check the licence before you embed.** Embedding redistributes the font file. The SIL Open Font License and Apache-2.0 – between them nearly every family on Google Fonts – permit this; most commercial *desktop* licences do not, and require a separate webfont licence. psi-slides prints a reminder and makes no attempt to verify anything. It is your call and your responsibility.

Eleven optional frontmatter keys pin how a lecture opens – `font`, `theme`, `collapse`, `auto-fit` (`true`, `false`, or `shrink`, which only ever makes a slide smaller), `slide-numbers`, `print-slide-numbers` (which follows `slide-numbers` unless you say otherwise), `editor`, `note-button`, `neighbours` (`dim` or `hidden`), `transition` (`pan`, `cut` or `fade`) and `reader`. A key that is present wins over the reader's stored preference; a key that is absent leaves it alone, so a lecture that pins nothing still follows whatever the reader last chose. The composition keys are separate and are not preferences at all: `cover`, `cover-image`, `cover-ratio`, `cover-align`, `section`, `section-mark`, `section-caption`, `ligatures`, `lang` (which also selects the words the build invents – the TOC heading, the note labels, the type eyebrow – so a German lecture reads German furniture), a top-level `labels:` block that overrides any one of those words, and a `style:` block carrying heading alignment, the hairlines and labels, block alignment, hyphenation, the printed face, the look of a bold phrase per view, and the two type scales. A key with an unknown value fails the build rather than being ignored, because a typo there is otherwise invisible – the lecture still builds and looks fine, it just looks like the author never set anything.

`editor: both | speaker | none` is checked the same way but is neither of those things: it decides which of the two live views carries the experimental figure editor, so what it changes is what ships in the file rather than how the lecture looks, and there is no reader preference for it to yield to. It defaults to `both`. The editor is built for a desktop and has substantial automated test coverage, but it has not yet been tried by many people.

**Video** uses the same shorthand as an image. `![](clip)` finds `assets/clip.mp4` and inlines it, up to a 12 MB per-file cap and while the deck's pictures and clips together stay under the 10 MB auto-inline budget; a clip past either, the build copies to a `videos/` folder beside the output, plays from there, and tells you the output now needs that folder. `--inline-images` inlines each clip up to its cap. A written-out URL works too – `![](https://host/clip.mp4)` – and is still an ordinary `<video>`, so play, pause and seeking stay synchronised between the projection and the cockpit.

**Hosted players** are a directive of their own, `::: embed <url>`, for YouTube and Vimeo. They are the one thing that makes an output fetch from a third party while you present, so the build says so every time. The frame loads only once its chunk is on screen and unloads when you leave it, nothing autoplays, and play/pause synchronise between projection and cockpit. YouTube additionally needs a real origin, so from a `file://` page it shows a card telling you to run `--serve`; the tutorial explains the whole thing.

**Self-test questions** go into the two documents and nowhere else. A `::: pulse` block under a chunk holds a question, one line of `---` and the answer; `print.html` and `print-notes.html` show the question with the answer folded behind a button, and the projection and the cockpit leave it out. The widget is [Pulse](https://pulse.psi.uni-bamberg.de), inlined into a document only when that document asks something. It sends nothing until the reader signs in with an email address; after that, their answers are kept in their account and the questions come back by mail at growing intervals. Printed on paper, each answer stands under its question. The tutorial has a part on it, and its `print.html` carries a few of them.

Two kinds of note are easy to confuse. A **note** (`> note:`) is yours, written in advance, shown in the cockpit and in the handout. An **annotation** (`N` during a talk) is typed live and the room sees it: while you type it fills the frame at a size the room can read, a single word large and centred, several lines as a block, an address with a QR code above it; `Esc` leaves it as a margin note. `Shift-E` plus `--integrate-annotations` writes annotations back into `source.md` as permanent text.

## Writing lectures with an LLM assistant

A lecture source is a good thing to hand a language model. It is plain
Markdown with a small, closed grammar: eleven types, four widths, sixteen `:::`
directives, one reveal separator. There is nothing to guess at and no binary
format in the way, so a model that has been shown the rules produces sources
that build and lint on the first pass. Diffs stay reviewable, because the unit
of change is a paragraph of prose rather than a slide object.

What still needs you: the argument, the examples, and the judgement about what
belongs on the screen. A model is useful for turning a draft into chunks,
proposing IDs and widths, tightening topic sentences so the collapsed view
reads well, and fixing what the linter flags.

Hand it one artefact rather than five. This repo ships a skill at
[`.claude/skills/psi-slides-authoring/`](.claude/skills/psi-slides-authoring/SKILL.md)
that bundles the whole authoring contract – grammar, directives, collapse
mechanisms, math, frontmatter – plus a companion file on topic sentences,
bold discipline, and typography. Claude Code picks it up automatically inside
this repository or a content repo that has a copy; for any other assistant,
paste the two files into the context.

If you would rather not use the skill, the minimum useful set is:

- [`lectures/tutorial/source.md`](lectures/tutorial/source.md) – the canonical
  reference for the basics; with `lectures/diagrams/` and `lectures/decoration/`
  it shows every directive in real use.
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) – the conventions, the parsing contract, and the
  things that are easy to get wrong.
- `node lint.js <source.md>` after every edit. It catches unknown types and
  widths, missing or duplicate IDs, unclosed directives, over-budget chunks
  and frontmatter keys that no renderer reads, which is most of what a model
  gets wrong.

Two things go wrong often enough to be worth naming. Models invent plausible
directives that do not exist (`::: columns`, `::: note`, extra classes in
`{...}`) – the linter catches those. And they renumber `{#id}` attributes when
they rewrite a heading, which silently breaks cross-references, contents
entries, and stored speaker state; say so up front, because no check will catch
it.

## When to use this

- Your lecture and its script should be one document, and you are tired of them drifting apart.
- You want a handout that reads as prose, not slides printed six-up.
- You want slides in git – diffable in review, greppable across semesters, mergeable.
- You teach code. Highlighting is [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) at build time, so it is exact and there is no runtime highlighter to load.
- You present from one laptop with an extended display.
- You care how the text sits on the page and would rather compose a lecture than fill a template.

## When *not* to use this

- **You need `.pptx` or Keynote interop, or a corporate template.** There is no export path. The output is HTML; the only bridge to a slide deck is printing to PDF.
- **A co-author needs a stable, fully graphical workflow.** The source of record is Markdown. The experimental diagram editor can adjust figures and write their source back, but it does not edit the rest of a lecture and is not yet a production-tested substitute for text authoring.
- **You want slide transitions, or motion for its own sake.** A slide change is a pan, a cut or a fade (`transition:`), and nothing more elaborate is planned. The other motion is three mechanisms, all of them on the same key and all of them inside one slide: reveal segments uncover blocks of text in place; a `::: draw` block can be stepped, so elements appear, disappear, move, and the arrows between them re-route as they go; and a `::: backdrop` can open or close its window over the slide, which is how a title is revealed in the paper a photograph gives up.
- **You want the cockpit on a tablet and the slides on the projector.** The design rules it out: the cockpit is a window the audience view opened, and the two talk to each other as parent and popup, which means same machine, same browser, same profile. Syncing over a network is deferred, not planned.
- **You need more than KaTeX covers.** `$inline$` and `$$display$$` work and render at build time, but that is KaTeX, not LaTeX: no equation numbering or `\ref`, no `mhchem`, no TikZ. If your lecture is a mathematics lecture, check [KaTeX's supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) before committing.
- **You need polls, quizzes, or any audience interaction during the talk.** Named and deferred in `PRD.md`. What exists is `::: pulse`, a question in the two documents that a reader answers afterwards; the projection carries none.
- **Your room's browser is old or locked down.** See [Requirements](#requirements) – the stylesheets use modern CSS with no fallbacks.
- **You want a dependable dependency.** One `build.js` of over thirty-two thousand lines, one maintainer, and a test suite of fast checks without a browser plus a browser suite for what only a built page can break. The source format is stable within a major version; nothing behind it is promised. It is used in earnest, but it is used by the person who wrote it.
- **Nobody is going to speak.** If the artefact is a document that has to carry itself – a retrospective, a project report, something you send to the people who could not attend – then the cockpit and the collapse mechanism are machinery you will not use. That is the sibling project, [**psi-briefing**](https://github.com/UBA-PSI/psi-briefing): text-dense 16:9 slides in one HTML file that carries everything it needs, written as Markdown and laid out by inference from the shape of the content. The line between the two is whether anyone is talking.

## How it compares

What is different here is the combination: one text rendered at two densities, a presenter cockpit that needs no server, and a prose handout – all from a single source and all in files that fetch nothing at run time. Every tool in this space is good, and nearly all of them take Markdown, so “it uses Markdown” is not a reason to pick this one. [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) beats it on math, citations and sheer durability; [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is broader and better supported; [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), [Marp](https://marp.app/) and [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) are better at being slide decks; PowerPoint wins the moment a colleague has to edit your file.

**[docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md)** is the long version: nine alternatives across twenty dimensions, including the ones psi-slides loses on.

## Requirements

- **Node 22+** to build. Nothing at read time: each output carries everything it needs and opens from `file://`.
- **A current browser** to read. The stylesheets use `oklch()` colours, `:has()`, and `text-wrap: balance` with no fallbacks, which puts the floor at roughly **Chrome/Edge 114, Firefox 121, Safari 17.5**. Lectures with inline-styled SVG assets additionally need `@scope`: Chrome/Edge 118, Safari 17.4, Firefox 146. Development and real use are in Chrome; other browsers are untested rather than unsupported.
- **A Chromium**, but only if you use `--slides-pdf`, `--print-pdf` or `--print-notes-pdf`. `playwright-core` is an optional dependency, so `npm install` normally provides one; `$PSI_CHROME`, the Playwright cache and a system Google Chrome are searched in that order. Nothing else in the build needs a browser, and the PDF export is the only thing that stops working without one. The desktop builder needs none of this: it prints with its own Chromium.
- **`cwebp` or `magick`** on `PATH` for WebP. `--optimize-images` needs one and refuses without it; the default build uses one to transcode an inlined PNG or JPEG and, without one, inlines the original bytes and says so. macOS `sips` cannot write WebP, so there is no zero-install fallback.
- Image assets are inlined automatically when they total under 10 MB. A single asset over 2 MB fails the build rather than silently shipping an external path – `--optimize-images` converts the offenders to WebP (and downscales a photograph that WebP alone does not bring under the cap), and `--no-inline-images` is the escape hatch.
- Math is rendered at build time, so the KaTeX fonts have to travel inside the HTML or the output stops opening from `file://`. Only the font families a lecture's formulas actually use are inlined – the tutorial's five come to 166 KB of the 254 KB the full set costs – and a lecture without math inlines none of it. The build prints what it did.

## What this fork adds

This fork sits on upstream psi-slides **2.0.0** and follows upstream read-only: new upstream releases are merged in, nothing is sent back (no pull requests, no issues, no pushes), and where 2.0.0 does the same thing the upstream way wins – `neighbours` and figure legibility are the two cases so far. The fork keeps no version number of its own; its changes are listed under `[Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**Safari is a first-class target.** Two browser specs (`test/figure-edge.mjs`, `test/frame-fade.mjs`) compare pixels in Chromium and WebKit; run `npx playwright install webkit` once so their WebKit half runs.

Everything below is off unless a deck writes it. Details live in the skills (`.claude/skills/psi-slides-*`) and in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); every example here builds.

**Identity and colour**

- `identity:` – a house accent, ink, logo and footer. `accent`, `accent-dark`, `ink`, `logo`, `logo-place: footer | corner | none`, `logo-print: cover | every | none`, `footer-left`, `footer-right`. The build measures which ink carries on the accent and says so. `logo` is read like every other file a deck names: from the lecture's own folder or the one above it, never from a dot-folder or through a link – a logo kept elsewhere is copied next to the `source.md`; otherwise `asset-outside-root` (error) and the build refuses.
- `palette:` – `tone-1` … `tone-4` for figures and cards, plus `link`, `info`, `task`, `example`, `takeaway` for activity boxes. Hex values, quoted. Lint: `tone-contrast` for tones too light as chart columns.
- `tone-1-text` … `tone-4-text` in `palette:` – a darker step of a tone for **words** in it: card headings and sub-lines, open-column bullets, row terms, figure labels in the tone. Fills, rules and edges keep the tone; `{.number}` badges and figure dots take the text step too, so their digit can be read and the two stay one mark. `palette: {task-text: …}` and the other activity kinds do the same for a box's mark. Example: `palette: {tone-3: "#3FA46A", tone-3-text: "#2C7349"}`. Lint: `tone-text-contrast` when the words in a tone fall under 4.5:1.
- `icons: fontawesome-free` – `:fa-name:`, `:far-name:`, `:fab-name:` inline, coloured like the text they sit in.
- `style: {ink-soft: N}` – how far the **quiet text** (captions, marginalia, card sub-lines, recall references, `.muted` figure labels) goes from `identity.ink` toward the paper. Default 68. It exists because 68 % of a mid-grey ink is not quiet but unreadable, and the failure is invisible from the key that causes it: `ink: "#4d4d4d"` carries 8:1 itself and hands every one of those 3.7:1, on every slide at once. The build measures it against the live light paper (#f8f8f8) and **solves** the step that clears 4.5:1 rather than guessing one, so the number it prints is the one to write. Two of its tokens are a parsed contract: `[identity] … the quiet text … carries <n>:1`.

- `style: {fill: 85, line: 60, edge-dark: 30}` – derived colours as fixed CI steps: a toned surface is the tone plus 85 % white, its rule plus 60 % white, the hard edge plus 30 % black, mixed in sRGB so the hex matches a design manual's table. Light themes and print; 0 (default) keeps the engine's own mixes. Lint `tone-text-contrast` then also measures words on that fill, the badge digit and the edge.

**Boxes, cards, rows**

- `style: {elevation: offset}` – a hard 45° edge under cards, boxes and figure boxes, printed. Also `flat` (default), `soft`, `lifted`.
- `style: {edge: tone}` – that edge in the box's own colour instead of a darker shade (`shade`, default).
- `::: activity link | info | task | example | takeaway` – a box with a drawn mark in its kind's colour. One sentence; `takeaway` at most once per slide.
- A card's own colour: `- **HTML** {.tone-2}\` (also `{.accent}`); a whole row `::: cards 3 {.tone-2}` or `{.tones}` in turn.
- A row's own colour: `- **Term** {.tone-2} the body` in `::: rows`. Lint: `cards-card-tone` for another word.
- Open columns: `::: cards 2 {.clear .dashed .show}` – no fill, heading, sub-line and square bullets in the card's tone, a dashed rule between the columns (`rule` slot: `none` | `dashed`, refused on rows: `cards-rule-rows`). A sub-line is the line under a heading written wholly in `*…*`:
  ```md
  ::: cards 2 {.clear .dashed .show}
  - **Old protocol** {.tone-2}\
    *deprecated*
    - designed in 1995
  - **New protocol** {.accent}\
    *current*
    - designed in 2018
  :::
  ```
- Numbered badges: `::: cards 3 {.number}` or `::: rows {.number}` – a filled circle 1, 2, 3 in each item's colour before its heading (`mark` slot: `none` | `number`). The figure side is a toned `dot n2 "2" above b {.tone-2}`, drawn solid under `offset`. Let card N arrive with figure step N by writing `--- from N` before it.

**Text**

- `style: {question-body: ink}` – a `## question:` body in the full ink instead of the quiet grey. The quiet body is right for a rhetorical question with an aside under it, and wrong for a vote, where the A/B/C options in the body are the content the back row has to read. Live only; the default `soft` is unchanged.
- `style: {slide-bold: ink}` – every bold inside `::: slide` in the ink, and only the `*…*` stress inside it in the accent (card headings and row terms keep their tone). Default `accent`.
- `::: table {.tone-1 .row-2}` around a Markdown table – header in the ink over a rule, hairlines, an optional header tone and exactly one highlight: `.row-N`, `.col-N` or `.cell-R-C`. Lint: `bad-table` for two highlights or an unknown word, `table-size` for a slide table above 5 rows × 4 columns.

**Figures**

- Under `offset`, a `::: draw` box looks like a card: the tone as a tint, the first label line as its heading, the hard edge. The edge is drawn as a shape behind the box, not a CSS filter, so Safari shows it too – and it moves with the box on a beat.
- Flat field bars: `default box h 2.4 {.bare .mono}` and toned boxes `right of … gap 0` – tint without outline or edge, the name in ink and the lines under it in the tone.
- A leader that turns once: `edge m.bottom -- note.left {.elbow .muted}` between anchors on crossing axes.
- Figure legibility is upstream's canvas rule now: `--check-fit` and the build report `figure-overflows-canvas`, `figure-underfills-canvas` and `figure-type-small`, and `style: {figure-type: N}` / `{.figure-type-N}` set how large a base label is against the body text. Fix for a strip that overflows: fewer canvas units (`::: draw 60x10`, not `150x24`). The fork's own "labels under 70% of the body text" report is gone.
- A figure label that will not survive the projection is named, in pixels, while the figure compiles: a box whose written `w` cannot hold its own words, and an edge caption painted over by the elements at either end. Both end with what to do about it, and an edge that already carries a `side` is not told to add one. Because they print several screens above the line that says the build wrote the views, the build **repeats the count last**: `[diagram] 3 figure warning(s) above`. They do not fail the build – what is drawn is the author's call – so a course that wants them fatal greps that line in its own render step. Those five tokens are a parsed contract; the sentence after the colon is not.
- **Icon tokens do not work inside `::: draw`.** A diagram label is measured and drawn as glyphs, so `box a ":fa-key: Key"` puts eight literal characters on the projector, `icons:` set or not. Lint: `icon-in-draw`.

**Across lectures**

- `::: recall ../networks-1/source.md#osi-layers` in a chunk (typically `## recall: {#r-osi}`) – shows that slide again, read from the other lecture's current source at every build (only from the lecture's own folder or the one above it, under the same file rule as a picture; `asset-outside-root` otherwise), under a `Recap · <title>` tag. The handout carries a reference line to the original instead of its text, and only this chunk's own notes. Lint: `recall-missing`, `recall-nested`.

**Dividers and print**

- `section: poster` – the accent edge to edge, the heading large in spaced capitals, the line under `# Heading` as a caption, pastel shapes arranged per part. `section-ink: auto | light | dark` overrules the measured ink for its two lines; `light` on a pale accent is reported, not hidden.
- `neighbours: hidden` – upstream's top-level frontmatter key (`dim | hidden`, default `hidden` under `transition: cut | fade`). The fork's earlier `style: {neighbours}` gave way to it and is refused with a pointer.
- `style: {print-pages: slide}` – the handout reads like a small book: every chunk and every part opens a page. Default `flow`.

**The diagram editor is experimental**: automated tests cover it extensively, but broad human testing has not happened yet. The same goes for the `editor:` frontmatter key, which decides whether the live views carry the editor at all.

The linter checks unknown types and widths, duplicate or missing chunk IDs, unclosed `:::` directives and unclosed `$$` math, per-type word budgets, duplicate explicit-slide blocks, assets over the inline cap, reveal overuse, orphan columns, and redundant figure captions. A source file can silence a warning with `<!-- linter: ignore reveal-overuse, density -->`; an error cannot be silenced.

**The live prompter (`--prompter`) is off unless you switch it on.** Run the lecture with `node build.js <source.md> --watch --prompter` and the cockpit listens while you talk. When something needs saying, it shows a short hint on a strip across the bottom of its copy of the slide: you are behind time, a point stays abstract although your slides have an example for it, what you just said contradicts your own slide, you are speaking too fast, or your notes planned something on this slide that you have walked past. It can also add a cue card to a slide still to come, the last slide included, when you said something in passing that is worth saying again there. (The cockpit's `K` mode shows your speaker notes as cue cards; in the ordinary layout the added card appears on the strip when you reach that slide.) A transcript carries no speaking rate, hesitation or silence, so psi-slides counts words a minute, filler sounds and the longest pause itself and hands the model the figures. Chrome's speech recognition often drops filler sounds, so a count of zero proves nothing.

`Shift`-`S` in the cockpit switches the prompter on and off, and nothing listens until you press it. For the first minute a faint line under the strip shows the words the speech recognition picks up, so you can see that it works. After that the same line says when the prompter last asked the model, so you can tell a prompter with nothing to say from one that has stopped.

**The prompter needs an internet connection and an OpenRouter account, and its calls cost money.** It also needs Chrome, because the listening is Chrome's own speech recognition (the Web Speech API), and `--watch`, which keeps `node build.js` running: the cockpit hands what it hears to that running program, and the program asks a language model through openrouter.ai. You create an API key in your OpenRouter account and put it in the environment variable `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` before the talk; each call is charged to that account. What a talk costs depends on the model and on how often the prompter asks. For a sense of scale: one keynote, together with every rehearsal and test run before it, came to about one US dollar with the default model, Claude Sonnet 5. The prompter makes at most 360 calls an hour unless `calls-per-hour` in the `prompter:` block sets a lower limit. Without the key the prompter starts switched off and only writes down what it heard.

**The prompter sends text to openrouter.ai:** the transcript and the lecture's text, speaker notes included. From there it goes to the company that runs the model. The prompter sends no audio. The speech recognition is Chrome's, though, and Chrome sends the audio to Google unless it can run the recognition on your own device; the cockpit says which of the two you are getting. None of this appears on the projection or is written back into `source.md`. `node build.js` reads the key from the environment and never writes it into the HTML files. To try the prompter without calling a model, add `--prompter-dry-run`: it does everything except that call and needs no key, and with recognition on the device, nothing leaves your computer at all. A run makes at most `calls-per-hour` calls in any hour (360 unless the `prompter:` block at the top of `source.md` says otherwise). You pay for the model named in `prompter: {model: …}`, so check its price before you rehearse with an unfamiliar one.

**Each run writes a log beside `source.md`** (`prompter-<date>.jsonl`): what it heard, which hints it showed, and what it wanted to say but its rules stopped, with the rule that stopped it. `--prompter-replay` reads a log back and prints, answer by answer, what the model proposed and what today's rules would do with it. Beside the log, `prompter-<hash>.prompt.txt` holds the lecture's text exactly as the model got it. The log holds your spoken words verbatim. This repository's `.gitignore` covers both files; a lecture kept in a repository of its own needs `prompter-*.jsonl` and `prompter-*.prompt.txt` in its own `.gitignore`. `node build.js` prints the log's full path each time it starts.

**The microphone hears the whole room.** Questions and remarks from the audience are transcribed and sent to the model like your own words. Tell the audience before the talk that the prompter is listening, and switch it off with `Shift`-`S` when someone from the room speaks, for example during questions. Whether you may use it in your setting is for you to check: data protection law (in the EU the GDPR) and the personal rights of the people in the room cover their words too.

## Hotkeys

Press `?` in either live view for the full on-screen reference. The ones you need on day one:

- Forward is one key family: `Space`, `↓`, `Enter`, `PageDown`. It uncovers the next reveal segment or diagram step on the chunk you are on; once there is nothing left to uncover it moves to the next chunk, and at the end of a column it carries on into the next column.
- Backward is the mirror: `↑`, `PageUp`, `Backspace`. It takes the last reveal back, and leaves the chunk only once the chunk is back at its opening state.
- `→` and `←` are that same forward/backward pair, on every slide.
- `Shift`-`→` and `Shift`-`←` are the next and previous column, from anywhere. `Shift`-`←` rewinds to the head of the column you are in before it leaves for the one before it.
- A faint `⌄` at the foot of the slide appears when the next forward press will leave the column.
- `1`–`9` open expansions – so does clicking the chevron. `Esc` backs out.
- `O` overview (the letter, not zero – zero resets the zoom), `T` table of contents, `/` search from anywhere – a hit list of every slide that mentions the word.
- `C` collapse, `F` font, `A` accent theme, `+` `-` `0` zoom.
- `#` auto-fit, in three: off, shrink a slide too big for the frame, size every slide to the screen. `B` blanks the projection – the speaker window keeps working so you can change slide while the room sees black.
- `D` puts a live demo on the projection: a window or a screen of this machine, picked in the speaker window, shown to the room until `D` again. Serve the lecture with `--serve` and the picture crosses without an encoder; from a double-clicked file it goes through a loopback WebRTC connection. **The very first capture on a Mac does not work** – macOS asks for screen-recording rights for the browser, and that first attempt is refused or shows an empty picture that ends by itself. Allow it, press `D` again, and it works from then on; try it once before the talk.
- `Shift`-`S` in the speaker window switches the live prompter on and off, when the lecture runs with `--watch --prompter`. The `◌ prompter` button in the footer does the same, and `Shift`-clicking it shows the last ten hints and cards. `Esc` removes the hint currently on the strip.
- `S` open the speaker window, `P` open the print view.
- **On a touchscreen** both live views show a small rail along the bottom: forward, back, overview and zoom, with `C`, `F`, `A`, `#`, search and text selection behind the `⋯` button. It appears only on a device with no fine pointer, so an iPad with a keyboard attached does not see it.
- `L` slide numbers: stacked, in a row, or off. `M` shows or hides the `+ note` button that sits in the slide's left gutter – the key it stands for, `N`, works either way.

## What is stable and what is not

The **source format is the interface**: a change that stops an existing `source.md` from building the same way is a major version. 2.0.0 is one: a lecture written for 1.0.0 may need an edit, and the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)'s Breaking list says which. That is a promise about the format, not about the internals – `build.js` is one file and its insides are rearranged whenever it helps. Two consequences worth knowing:

- **`{#id}` attributes are frozen once authored.** They anchor cross-references, TOC entries, sync snapshots, and `localStorage`. Renaming a heading is free; renumbering an ID is not.
- **Generated HTML is disposable.** Rebuild it, do not commit it. The only tracked outputs are the three reference lectures – `lectures/tutorial/`, `lectures/diagrams/` and `lectures/decoration/` – so the tour and the two construct references can be browsed straight from the repository. Rebuild those with `npm run build:tracked`, which skips the WebP step so the bytes do not depend on the encoder installed.

## Security

**A lecture someone sends you is a web page written by that person.** Its HTML can run JavaScript in your browser and tell a server that you opened it, and no version of psi-slides can stop that, because the author decides what goes into the file. A lecture made from Markdown and local files alone makes no network requests. **Run `node build.js` on someone else's `source.md` only with psi-slides 2.0.0 or later**, and even then it may read pictures, clips and fonts from the folder one level above its own. [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) has the details – what a lecture's files can reach on your computer, what `node build.js` refuses, what the live tools and the prompter expose – and how to report a vulnerability privately.
