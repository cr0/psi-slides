# `speaker.html` – Phase 1 Spec

Short spec for the speaker view and its sync protocol with `audience.html`. Commits once this lands; changes after that require moving both HTML outputs together. Read alongside `PRD.md` §7.

## 1. Scope

**In (Phase 1, this slice):**
- New output `speaker.html`, built from the same `source.md` as `audience.html` and `print.html`.
- `window.postMessage` sync between audience and speaker via the opener relationship (audience spawns speaker via `S`, both windows hold cross-references). Works across `file://` origins where `BroadcastChannel` is isolated by Chrome's per-file opaque-origin policy.
- Three-panel layout: current-chunk mirror (centered), next-previews (bottom strip, 2-3 upcoming), notes pane (right).
- Column-level **scrubber** (top or bottom edge): flat list of column headings + chunk-count pips, click jumps. No full chunk thumbnails.
- **Freeze toggle** (`V`, or the footer button): when frozen, the room holds the slide it is on while the speaker moves ahead privately; thawing catches the room up. Live by default.
- **Timer**: elapsed since speaker-page load, `mm:ss`, non-pausable. Resets on reload.
- **`S` from audience** opens `speaker.html` in a new tab.
- localStorage crash recovery: every 5 s, persist `activeIdx`, `revealed`, `collapse`, `zoom`, `annotations`, elapsed-seconds.

**Out (deferred to later Phase 1 / Phase 2):**
- Live sketch-slot editing (no sketch slots in the current lectures anyway – `::: sketch` is parsed but not rendered).
- Full-thumbnail scrubber.
- Second-machine / WebSocket sync (explicit PRD §7 non-goal for now).
- Pause and target on the timer (a click restarts it; the cue cards carry `@mm:ss` targets per card).

**Explicit non-features (Phase 2+):**
- Student-facing `study.html` (PRD §12.3 open question).
- Poll / quiz slots.

## 2. State ownership and sync

The audience is the **state root**. The speaker owns a **local shadow** of the state, plus a `frozen` flag that governs whether speaker-originated changes are broadcast.

`frozen` is the projector's metaphor, not the protocol's. It started life as a `pushEnabled` toggle with a companion `.` key that force-pushed one snapshot – two controls describing what the code does (send a snapshot) rather than what the lecturer wants (hold the image while I read ahead). Inverting and renaming it collapses the pair into one: thawing *is* the resync, because the first thing an ungated broadcast does is hand the room the current state. `toggleFreeze()` therefore sends a snapshot directly on the way out of frozen, or unfreezing on the slide you meant to land on would appear to do nothing. The snapshot does not carry the focus card or a brought-in aside – those travel as `figure-*` messages, and a frozen cockpit sent none – so the thaw sends them after it (`figureFocusState`): `figure-focus` plus `figure-view` for an open card or `figure-unfocus`, and `figure-pan` or `figure-unpan`. Without them a card closed while frozen stayed on the projection, because the snapshot was on the same slide and only a slide change takes a card down.

**Frozen is private in both directions.** A frozen cockpit is the lecturer's look-ahead, so the gate holds incoming traffic as well as outgoing (`viewHooks.lookingAhead()`, which the audience answers `false`):

- An incoming `state` snapshot does not move it. It used to: the projection's `autoplay` ticks, or `B` pressed on the projection's keyboard, each sent a snapshot that dragged the look-ahead back to the room's slide and overwrote its reveals and annotation drafts. Of a snapshot a frozen cockpit takes two facts about the room and nothing about the deck – `blanked` and the projection's size (`applyFrozenState`). What the projection changed meanwhile is lost on thaw, because thawing pushes the cockpit's whole snapshot; that is the promise of the key.
- An incoming `pan` does not move its camera, and it sends no laser pointer (`cursor`): the dot would land on a slide the room is not looking at. Freezing takes a dot already on the wall down.
- It does not write the stored position (§5). The two windows share one `activeIdx` key, so a projection reloaded under a freeze booted onto the cockpit's look-ahead. Thawing writes it, since the room is then on the cockpit's slide.

Seven message families deliberately bypass the freeze gate, because all of them are commands to the projector rather than shared state:

- `blank` – `B` must reach the projection whether or not the cockpit is frozen. It is the key you hit when something has to come off the screen *now*, and a gated `B` would toast “projection blanked” at a projection that stayed lit.
- `slide-ref` – the audience window's dimensions after a resize (§3).
- `link-show` / `link-hide` – the address overlay, below.
- `demo` (`{action: 'live' | 'stop'}`) plus `demo-offer` / `demo-answer` / `demo-ice` – the live demo, below.
- `fullscreen` (`{action: 'enter' | 'exit' | 'state', on?}`) – the projection's own frame, `W`, below.
- `note-button` (`{mode: 'on' | 'off'}`) – the `+ note` affordance in the slide's left gutter, shown or hidden. `M` toggles it, and the button exists **only in the audience window** while the lecturer's keyboard is in the cockpit, so a press that did not travel would do nothing anywhere. Both windows apply it, so the cockpit agrees about what the room is looking at. It is deliberately not a field of the snapshot: `applyRemoteState` is a full apply, and a snapshot sent to say “the button is hidden” would drag the receiver's slide position with it. The frontmatter key that pins its starting value is `note-button: on | off`, and each window remembers the reader's own answer in `localStorage` under `psi-slides:note-button`.

**Live demo (`D`).** A window or a screen of the machine, captured with `getDisplayMedia` and shown on the projection as video, so a demo can run on the laptop screen of an extended desktop without mirroring the displays around it. The capture has to start from a key press in the window that calls the API, and the picker opens in that window – so the cockpit captures and the projection shows, which puts the picker on the laptop and never on the wall. Running alone, the audience window captures and shows for itself. How the stream crosses to the other window is decided at run time: served over http (`--serve`) both windows share an origin and the audience plays the cockpit's `MediaStream` directly through `peer.psiDemoAttach(stream)` – no copy, no encoder; from `file://` that call throws and the stream goes through an `RTCPeerConnection` on loopback, its offer, answer and ICE candidates carried by the three `demo-*` messages. Chromium 141 cannot transfer a `MediaStreamTrack` between windows in either case, which is why the direct path is a call and not a `postMessage` transfer. `D` in either window ends it on both; so does Chrome's own “stop sharing” bar. A stop is always also a message, because `track.stop()` fires no `ended` on the far side. Blank hides the demo overlay on the projection like everything else while the capture keeps running. Not in the snapshot: a stream cannot be re-applied from one, only its holder can hand it over again. So the projection sends `hello` whenever it adopts a peer – a cockpit that booted, or the one it lost to its own reload – and a window holding a capture answers any `hello` by delivering it again (`demoAnnounce`). A reloaded projection gets the picture back on the cockpit's next push; a cockpit opened with `S` under a demo the projection started alone learns of it and shows the badge.

**Fullscreen (`W`).** A room wants the slide and nothing else, and a browser window carries an address bar, a tab strip and a menu bar above it. **`W` means the projection, `Shift`-`W` means this window** – in the audience the two are the same window, so plain `W` there simply fills it; in the cockpit plain `W` is a command sent to the projector and the cockpit deliberately stays where it is, because a lecturer reading notes off a laptop wants the notes, not a full-screen mirror of the room.

**The constraint, measured rather than assumed.** `requestFullscreen` is one of the calls a browser grants only to a user gesture *in the window that makes it*. Chromium refuses a request issued from a `message` handler with `TypeError: Permissions check failed` – headless and headed alike, verified against Chromium 141 in a two-window rig and again in `test/nav-fullscreen.mjs`. So the cockpit's `W` **cannot** put the projection into fullscreen; it can only **arm** it. The projection shows one quiet line in the bottom-right corner (`#psiINT-fullscreen-hint` – *fullscreen · click anywhere, or hit W on this screen*) and spends the **next click anywhere on that window** on entering, in the capture phase and once, so the click that answers the hint is not also a click on the figure it landed on. `W` on the projection's own keyboard does it too. The arming lapses after 20 seconds, because an affordance nobody took must not stay on the wall for the rest of the talk; `W` asks again. The cockpit says which of the two happened in a toast.

**Leaving costs nothing.** `exitFullscreen()` needs no gesture, so the cockpit's `W` takes the projection straight back out, with no hint and no click. The asymmetry is the browser's. `Escape` is the browser's own way out and never passes through this tool at all, which is why the page must not swallow it – the `Escape` branch of the key map calls `preventDefault` only on the targets it actually unwinds.

**Nothing of this is in the snapshot**, and not only for the usual reason. Fullscreen is a property of *one window on one screen* – the projector is full and the laptop is not – so there is no shared value a snapshot could carry; and `applyRemoteState` is a full apply, so one sent to carry it would drag the receiver's slide position with it. The projection instead reports where it is (`{action: 'state', on}`) on every `fullscreenchange` and on every `hello`, which is what lets the cockpit's `W` toggle the right way after an `Escape` it never saw, and after a reload on either side.

**The frame changes size, so everything solved against it is stale.** Entering and leaving both fire `resize`, which re-runs `setSlideRef` (`--slide-w`, `--slide-h`, `--audience-aspect`), re-sends `slide-ref` to the cockpit, and re-solves the camera – all of that was already there. One thing was not: `clampZoomToWidth` deliberately stands aside while auto-fit is on, so a deck under `auto-fit` kept the zoom that fitted the *windowed* frame. The resize listener now calls `autoFitNow()` first. It went unnoticed while a resize meant a lecturer dragging a window edge; `W` makes it the ordinary path.

**Three message types travel outside the snapshot but are still gated**, because they are shared state that simply must not be folded into a full apply: `video`, `embed` and `diagram-edit`. `applyRemoteState` is a *full* apply, so a snapshot sent to carry one of these would drag the receiver's slide position along with it. Each is addressed by the thing's own identity rather than by index – `data-fig-id` for a clip, the diagram's own id for an edit – so reordering a chunk cannot mis-target one, and each is echo-suppressed, because applying a remote change fires the local event that would otherwise bounce straight back.

| type | payload | who sends it |
|---|---|---|
| `video` | `{figId, action, time}` | either, on play / pause / seek |
| `embed` | `{figId, action, time}` | either, on a player transition |
| `diagram-edit` | `{id, source}` | either, on every committed edit in the diagram editor |
| `demo` | `{action}` | either, ungated (see above) – `live` when a capture starts, `stop` from whichever window ends it |
| `demo-offer` / `demo-answer` / `demo-ice` | `{sdp}` / `{sdp}` / `{candidate}` | the WebRTC handshake, `file://` only – the capturing window offers, the showing window answers |
| `note-button` | `{mode}` | either, ungated (see above) – on every `M` |
| `fullscreen` | `{action: 'enter' \| 'exit'}` | the cockpit, ungated – on every `W` there |
| `fullscreen` | `{action: 'state', on}` | the projection, ungated – on every `fullscreenchange` and every `hello` |

`diagram-edit` carries the **block body**, not a diff: a diagram body is a few hundred bytes to a couple of kilobytes, and the receiver re-runs the same compiler over it. That is what makes freeze work the way a lecturer expects – freeze, fix the figure, unfreeze, and the room gets the finished picture, because the receiver simply never saw the intermediate states. A private editing mode is therefore not a separate feature; it is `V`, and the editor says which of the two it is in, in one line of chrome.

**Links.** A plain click opens the link in a new tab of the window that was clicked; the renderer puts `target="_blank"` on external links, so the deck itself never navigates away. A small **mark** after the link shows the **address** on both screens instead, set large and with a **QR code**, and `Esc`, a click, or the next slide clears it on both. `Shift`-clicking the link itself does the same.

**Up to 1.0.0 `Shift`-click was the only route, and the mark is what changed.** The overlay was the answer to a question the room asks out loud – *what is that address* – and it was behind a modifier nothing on the slide mentioned, so a lecturer who had not read the docs never met it. The mark is a `<button>` after every `https?://` link, labelled, and answerable by `Enter` or `Space` – the key map stands back for it, or the deck's own `Space` binding would advance the slide instead; `style: {link-codes: off}` takes it away again for a deck that wants its links bare. `Shift`-click is unchanged. The address is itself a link, so clicking it opens the page in that window while leaving the overlay up for the room.

The QR is generated at build time, one per external address found in the rendered HTML, and shipped as an SVG map keyed by URL – so there is no encoder in the browser and a lecture without links pays nothing. It keeps a white ground on every theme, because scanners cope badly with inverted codes and the white card doubles as the quiet zone the spec requires. The encoder is a dependency (`qrcode-generator`, MIT, no dependencies of its own) rather than hand-rolled Reed-Solomon: an error in that maths produces codes that scan to the wrong string and look perfectly correct to the eye.

That is the considered answer to “can I open a page on the projector”. It is technically possible and a bad idea twice over: the lecturer would be driving a browser they cannot see from the lectern, and the room would be watching an unrelated interface instead of the lecture. It would also rest on `window.open` succeeding in the peer without a user gesture there, which is exactly what popup blockers exist to stop. What a room actually wants from a link mid-talk is to write it down, so the projection gets a URL to read rather than a page to watch – and the cockpit shows the identical overlay, so the lecturer knows precisely what went up.

**State that syncs** (both directions, gated by freeze):

| Field | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `activeIdx` | integer | current chunk |
| `revealed` | `{id: count}` | reveal segments per chunk |
| `collapse` | enum | `none` / `topic-bold` |
| `zoom` | float | text scale multiplier, whichever collapse mode is live |
| `blanked` | bool | audience blackout |
| `annotations` | `{id: string}` | speaker-edited, mirrors to audience |
| `annotEditingId` | id / null | so the non-editing peer raises the box to the frame and centres the chunk; the layer's sizes and its QR code are derived from the text on each side, never sent |
| `openExp` | `{chunkIdx, expIdx}` | expansions are mirrored, see below |
| `audienceW`, `audienceH` | integers | audience window dims; speaker matches its preview aspect |
| `panDx`, `panDy` | floats | manual drag-pan, layout-space |
| `overview` | bool | overview mode |
| `overviewScale` | float | overview zoom, clamped to 0.08 … 1 |
| `overviewAnchorIdx` | integer | chunk the overview camera is centred on |
| `selectedIdx` | integer | overview selection outline |

**State that stays local** (never posted to the peer):

| Field | Who owns it | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `tocVisible`, `searchActive`, search hits and cursor | per-view | navigational scratch space, not a shared surface. Committing a hit navigates, and *that* rides the normal snapshot |
| `collapsedZoom` | per-view | see below |
| notes-pane height, preview orientation | speaker only | physical-screen preferences, persisted globally |
| timer elapsed | speaker only | speaker-side artifact |
| the prompter on or off | speaker only | `--prompter` only. A microphone is an act of consent and the footer switch is where it is given, so the answer lives in `sessionStorage` and the projection is never told (§4.2, §5) |
| what the ear is doing | speaker only | the recogniser's state and its reason – denied, no microphone, on-device or through Google. It reaches the badge in this window and nothing else |
| the prompter's hints | speaker only | a whisper arrives as its own `souffleuse-hint` message on the watch socket (§3.1), is painted on `#psiINT-souffleuse-strip`, and is remembered in a local list of the last ten for the history panel. No field of `snapshot()` is the prompter's |
| the prompter's cue cards | speaker only | a card laid into an upcoming slide lives in `souffleuseCues`, a `Map` the cue rail is redrawn from – local for the same reason the cue cursor is: the projection does not know the cards exist |

**Per-mode zoom, without a new field.** The two collapse modes carry very different amounts of text, so they keep separate zoom levels: the collapsed slide holds whatever the lecturer set, and switching to the full text computes a zoom that makes the current chunk fit. Only the *live* zoom travels, as it always did. Each window additionally remembers, locally, the zoom that was live the last time `collapse` was `topic-bold` – including zooms that arrived in a remote snapshot. Because both windows see the same sequence of zoom values, the two memories agree without the protocol having to carry a second one. Widening the snapshot for a value that is derivable from what it already contains would have been the wrong trade.

**Camera and overview sync** (revised after implementation): the original design kept the whole overview cluster local, on the theory that overview is a private planning surface. That did not survive contact with a real two-screen setup – the lecturer looks at the speaker window while the projector shows the audience one, and an overview that only exists on one of them is worse than none.

The overview framing is therefore a pure function of `(overviewAnchorIdx, overviewScale, panDx, panDy)`, all four of which ride every snapshot. Consequences worth knowing:

- `selectedIdx` is *only* the outline. It deliberately does not drive the camera, so clicking a thumbnail in overview leaves the stage where it is. Keyboard selection and search-commit re-anchor (`overviewAnchorIdx = selectedIdx`) and zero the pan; a click does neither.
- `overview` used to travel in its own `{type: 'overview', active}` message that was only handled on the audience side. That single-directional handler is gone. Two channels for one fact is what let the speaker sit in normal-camera mode while adopting the audience's overview drag-pan, which drove its stage several thousand pixels off screen.

**Sync additions (revised after implementation):**

- `openExp` **is** synced after all. The interactive speaker mirror makes
  chevron clicks propagate to audience, which wouldn't work with audience-
  only state. The clean model is: openExp lives in the snapshot and both
  sides mirror it.

The speaker's “next previews” always render chunks **fully revealed** regardless of the synced `revealed` state (PRD §7 – the planning surface shows author-intent, not live pacing).

## 3. Message protocol

Transport: `window.postMessage(msg, '*')` between the two windows. The audience holds the speaker reference returned by `window.open(...)`; the speaker holds `window.opener`. A message is accepted by who sent it, not by the origin it reports: the sender must be the peer already held, this window's `window.opener`, or a window whose `opener` is this window (`isPeerWindow`). The origin check stays in front of that, but on `file://` every sender reports `"null"` – so does any sandboxed frame, including one inside an embedded player – and a frame posting `"null"` used to be adopted as the peer and obeyed, down to a `diagram-edit` whose markup ran script on the projection. A frame has no `opener` that is the page, and a popup a frame opens has the frame for one. The accepted sender becomes the peer, so an audience reload while the speaker is alive still recovers the link the moment the speaker next pushes: the speaker's `opener` is the audience's browsing context, not its document, so it is still the reloaded audience's own window. A speaker reload finds the audience through `window.opener` as before. What the check costs is a cockpit the projection has no relation to – a `speaker.html` opened by hand beside an `audience.html` opened by hand never connected either, since neither held a reference to the other. The audience answers that adoption with a `hello` of its own, which is how a running demo is handed over again (§2).

Every message is a **full snapshot**, never a diff. Snapshots are cheap, and this eliminates the class of bugs where a late-joiner sees a partially-reconstructed state.

```javascript
// Sent by either side on any syncable state change (if push enabled).
// Payload is the full field list from §2 – see snapshot() in build.js.
{
  type: 'state',
  source: 'audience' | 'speaker',
  payload: {
    activeIdx: number,
    revealed: { [chunkId: string]: number },
    collapse: 'none' | 'topic-bold',
    zoom: number,
    blanked: boolean,
    annotations: { [chunkId: string]: string },
    annotEditingId: string | null,
    openExp: { chunkIdx: number, expIdx: number } | null,
    audienceW: number, audienceH: number,
    panDx: number, panDy: number,
    overview: boolean,
    overviewScale: number,
    overviewAnchorIdx: number,
    selectedIdx: number,
  }
}

// Lightweight camera update, rAF-throttled during a drag or wheel-zoom so
// the peer follows smoothly without re-running the full snapshot apply
// 60x/second. The same fields also ride every 'state' snapshot, so a
// navigation or a freshly reconnected peer still converges on the framing.
{ type: 'pan', source, dx, dy, overviewScale, overviewAnchorIdx, selectedIdx }

// Speaker-to-audience only: laser pointer and figure inspection.
{ type: 'cursor', source: 'speaker', chunkIdx, x, y, target: 'chunk' | 'figure' }
{ type: 'figure-focus' | 'figure-pan', chunkIdx, figureIdx }
{ type: 'figure-unfocus' }
{ type: 'figure-unpan' }
{ type: 'figure-view', scale, panX, panY }

// Sent by speaker on open; audience replies with current state.
{ type: 'hello', source: 'speaker' }

// The cockpit handshake (S from file://, below): the projection asks a
// window it found but cannot read, the cockpit answers with its deck.
{ type: 'whois', source: 'audience' }
{ type: 'iam', source: 'speaker', deck }

// Audience reply to a hello.
{ type: 'state', source: 'audience', payload: { ... } }
```

The `figure-*` and `cursor` messages are the one remaining deliberately one-directional family: the audience acts on them, the speaker ignores them. Figure inspection is a lecturer gesture, and the audience window is normally on a projector nobody clicks.

`figure-pan` / `figure-unpan` carry the `::: marginalia` aside being brought into the frame and let go again. They are their own message types for the reason the three gated ones above are: a snapshot sent to say "the aside is in" is a full apply and would drag the receiver's slide position with it. What travels is **which aside**, never how far to move – each window solves the offset against its own frame, and the cockpit's scaled stage is a different size, so a shared pixel count would be wrong in one of them by construction. Same reasoning as `clampZoomToWidth` and the focused formula's fit.

Receive rule: any incoming `state` replaces the local state wholesale (except for the always-local fields in §2) – unless the receiver is a frozen cockpit, which takes only `blanked` and the projection's size (§2). No merging, no conflict resolution. If both sides edit the same field within one tick, last write wins.

Rebroadcast rule: **never** rebroadcast a received state. The sender is the single source of truth for that state-tick.

### 3.1 The prompter, on the watch socket

The live prompter (`--prompter`, `docs/history/PLAN-souffleuse.md`) is the one cockpit feature that talks to something other than the projection, and it deliberately does **not** use `postMessage`: its peer is a sidecar in the Node watch process, so it rides the existing nonce-guarded watch socket (`window.psiWatch`, emitted only under `--watch`). Every client message carries `type`, `id` and `nonce`, the nonce is checked before anything else, and the server answers `<type>-result` with `ok` and `why` – the same pairing a diagram's `patch` uses. One thing is new: **the server may speak first**. `psiWatch.on(type, fn)` is the listener map for those, consulted *after* the `-result` pairing, never instead of it, and `psiWatch.onConnect(fn)` fires on every open including the silent reconnects.

Client → server, each answered by `<type>-result`:

| type | fields | when |
|---|---|---|
| `souffleuse-hello` | `{lang, stt: {engine, local, onDevice, installing}}` | on switching on, and again after every reconnect – and a reconnect whose hello comes back refused (a restarted watcher has a new nonce, which this page does not have until a save reloads it) switches the cockpit off with the reason on the badge, rather than leaving a pressed switch over an ear nothing will answer. **A hello is a registration, not a switch**: it says which socket to whisper to, re-stamps the sidecar's idea of the cockpit clock, and lets the standing-hint slot go, because a fresh page holds no hint. Only `souffleuse-toggle` switches the prompter on. It used to do both, and the cockpit then had to undo it with a separate, un-awaited toggle whenever the answer said `enabled: false` – so a lost reply or a recogniser that would not start left the sidecar listening for a cockpit whose switch was off. The reply is `{enabled, model, cadence, cues, cueCards, session, dryRun, startQuiet}`: `cues` is the permission, `cueCards` is the list of cards already laid (`[{cueId, chunkId, text, at}]`), which is how a reloaded cockpit gets them back – they live in that window's memory alone. `at` rides along because the history is a record of when the prompter said something and a replayed card is not said again: without it the row that survived a reload carried the clock at replay time, which is quietly false rather than merely repeated. When the sidecar cannot work, `enabled` is false and **the reason rides in the reply's own `why`**, with `ok` still true: `reply` spreads the payload first so that no payload field can shadow a protocol one, which means a payload `why` would be overwritten. A second cockpit tab takes the hints over by sending one – and the displaced socket is told so, with a `souffleuse-status {state: 'idle', why: 'another cockpit took the prompter'}` sent before it is replaced. It used to be dropped in silence, and a second tab is one stray `S` in the projection away: the first window kept its switch pressed and its microphone open for the rest of the talk, sending a transcript nothing would answer |
| `souffleuse-say` | `{text, t0, t1, chunkId, idx, beat}` | one per final transcript segment. The times are seconds of **this window's** clock, unrounded to two decimals, because the sidecar counts its cadence in seconds of speech. `t0` is where the speaking started, taken from the recogniser's `speechstart` (or the first interim after a final, where that event does not arrive) – it was the end of the *previous* final, which put the pause between two sentences inside `t1 - t0`, so the longest silence was structurally zero and a sentence after a minute of thinking was rated at ten words a minute |
| `souffleuse-move` | `{chunkId, idx, beat, beats, elapsed}` | from `viewHooks.onActiveChange` and `onStateChange`, only when the position actually changed. `beat` is `cuePosition(entry).consumed`, the same number a cue card is filed under, and `beats` is that call's `total` – the second half of the model's `beat 2/3`, which exists in this window's DOM and nowhere else. The sidecar resolves a move by `idx`, never by id, because a divider's element id and the id the deck payload gives it are different strings. It also **clamps** the index to the deck it holds and logs a `warn` when it does: a rebuild that shortens the deck reaches it before the page reload does. And an `elapsed` that drops by more than five seconds is read as a new clock rather than as a talk that went backwards – see §5 |
| `souffleuse-dismiss` | `{hintId, how: 'esc' \| 'click' \| 'fade'}` | every way a hint leaves the strip. A cue shown in the classic layout carries no `hintId` and is dismissed locally – the sidecar filed it as a card, not as a hint |
| `souffleuse-toggle` | `{on}` | the switch, in both directions. It is the only thing that switches the prompter on, so it is sent again after every reconnect – the watcher may have been restarted under the page, and a fresh sidecar starts off |
| `souffleuse-prefs` | `{cues}` | the cue checkbox in the history panel, sent after a successful hello and on every change. Its own message rather than a field of `souffleuse-toggle`, because the box is changed mid-talk with the switch untouched and a switch message carrying a preference would mean two things at once. The deck's `prompter: {cues: off}` is the ceiling and this is the speaker's answer under it; with the cards off `cueTargets` is empty, so no cue is judged, no slide is locked against a second and nothing enters the duplicate rule. The reply is `{cues, cueCards}`, so ticking the box again brings back what unticking it cleared |

Server → client, unsolicited, delivered through `on()`:

| type | payload | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `souffleuse-hint` | `{hintId, kind, text, severity, at}` | one whisper that passed the policy. `kind` is `time` / `example` / `fact` / `delivery` / `pace` / `skipped`, `severity` is `low` / `high`. `pace` is separate from `delivery` because the two must not share a cool-down: manner is a moment, tempo is a condition that lasts minutes and comes back |
| `souffleuse-cue` | `{cueId, chunkId, text, at}` | a card for a slide that is still to come. Ignored by a cockpit whose cue switch is off |
| `souffleuse-status` | `{state, why}` | `listening` / `thinking` are the working pair; `off` is the sidecar saying it cannot work at all (no key, a refused key, five failures) and takes the switch with it – and the switch cannot undo it, because `setEnabled(true)` refuses while the sidecar is disabled and the toggle answers `{on: false, enabled: false}` with the reason; `idle` is the prompter having been switched off – by the cockpit's own switch or by the `{"type":"prompter","enabled":false}` command on the engine's stdin – and the cockpit treats it exactly like `off` except for the badge: the ear stops, the switch reads unpressed, the strip and its timers go and the consent in `sessionStorage` is dropped, so one press resumes and a reload does not. `off` keeps its reason on the badge, `idle` leaves the badge to whatever already stood on it; `error` is a backoff or a run of unusable answers |

**Who may open the socket, and what each view is told.** The watch server accepts a handshake only from a page opened from disk (Origin `null`, or `file://` as Chrome sends it) or one that `--serve` delivered (`http://localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]` with the served port); no Origin at all is a local program, not a browser, and is let through. A message over 4 MB is refused before it is parsed. The two live views open every connection with `{type: 'hello', nonce}`, answered with nothing, which marks the socket as this build's: a rebuild's `reload` goes to every socket, its `build-failed` – which quotes the source – only to marked ones. `print.html` and `print-notes.html` carry no nonce and no `psiWatch` at all, only a listener that reloads on `reload`: they are the views an author hands on, and a `--watch` build of one used to carry the secret that lets a page write to `source.md`. `--serve` answers only to its own `Host` (DNS rebinding) and never serves `source.md`, a dot-name or the prompter's files.

Without a sidecar the socket answers a `souffleuse-*` message with `ok: false` and `start the build with --prompter`. Nothing of this family is gated by freeze, and nothing of it is in the snapshot: the projection has no prompter and never hears about one.

```

- **Scrubber**: one `<button>` per column, showing `N. <heading>`. Below it, a row of dots – one per chunk – the active chunk's dot is filled. Click a button to jump to the column's first chunk. Click a dot to jump to that chunk.
- **Current chunk**: identical rendering to the audience (same `renderAudienceChunk`), same collapse mode, same reveal state. Full chunk frame, scaled to fill the pane.

  **Reveal preview.** The cockpit additionally draws the *one* segment that the next `Space` or `↓` will bring up, in place inside the slide, hatched and inside a dashed frame with a small `next` label. Only the immediate next one: the segments behind it stay hidden, or the preview would just be the un-collapsed chunk with decoration on top. `applyReveal` marks it with `data-next` in both views; only the speaker's stylesheet reacts.

  It is `position: absolute` with no offsets, which renders it at its static position – exactly where it will land – while contributing nothing to the chunk's height. That is load-bearing, not tidiness: the laser pointer travels as a fraction of the active chunk's bounding box, so a cockpit chunk taller than the projected one would put the dot in the wrong place. Measured on a three-segment chunk, an in-flow preview made the speaker's box 840px against the audience's 718.
- **Next previews**: 3 upcoming chunks (or fewer if near end), each at ~0.25 scale. No expansions, no annotations, no reveal – always fully revealed per PRD §7. Drag the handle on the strip's leading edge to resize it, in either orientation; double-click resets. Height and width are persisted under **separate** keys, because someone who flips the strip from the bottom to the right edge wants each shape to come back the way they left it. The stage keeps its letterbox throughout – it gives up the room and `#psiINT-stage-cell`'s ResizeObserver re-fits `--stage-scale`, so the mirror stays at the audience aspect instead of stretching.

  Implementation note worth keeping: the handle is a **grid item of its own** sharing the strip's cell, not an absolutely positioned child of the strip – the strip is a scroll container and a handle inside it would scroll away with the thumbnails. Sharing a cell also means the strip has to be *explicitly* placed (`grid-column: 1 / -1`), because grid auto-placement avoids an occupied cell rather than overlapping it; left on `auto` the strip was pushed into an implicit second column that `grid-template-columns` never declared.
- **Notes pane**: speaker notes extracted from `> note:` lines in source, per chunk. Drag the hairline bar on its top edge to resize (the stage preview rescales to fit via the `#psiINT-stage-cell` ResizeObserver); double-click the bar to return to automatic height. The height is persisted per user. The bar names the gesture on hover, because a 2px line is not self-explanatory and “how do I make the notes bigger” turned out to be the question the pane most reliably failed to answer. Two buttons in the pane's top-right corner scale the **text** independently of the pane's height, persisted per user. Deliberately no hotkey for those: this is the one surface the lecturer types into, and every free letter key is already a navigation command that would fire mid-sentence.
- **Clock**: a large tabular-figure button over the letterbox corner of the stage, top right, and in the cue-card header while those are up. It used to be an 11 px span in the footer, between the freeze button and the key crib, and it was the one thing there the lecturer looks at every minute – and could not find. A click restarts it at 0:00: it starts when the page loads, which is ten minutes early whenever the cockpit is opened before the room fills. The word RESET appears in the button on hover, because a clock that jumps to zero under a stray click reads as a fault unless it said so first. Deliberately no pause – a paused clock is one stray click from a drift that is wrong for the rest of the talk. When the deck carries `@mm:ss` marks on its cue cards, the drift against them stands beside the clock, rounded to ten seconds, red when behind. Behind is measured against the *next* mark and ahead against the last one passed, with a signed zero in between: a cover marked @0:00 whose successor is marked @2:30 is on budget for those two and a half minutes, rather than climbing to “+2:16 behind” on a talk that is exactly on plan. Past the last mark that mark is the reference again, and before the first one it is that first mark – so the number is there from the opening slide and does not vanish on a slide that carries no mark of its own. A deck with no marks at all shows nothing.
- **Cue cards** (`K`, or the footer's `▤ cards`): the third arrangement of the window. The notes of the active chunk as cards down a rail on the right, the mirror of the projection small in the top-left corner with the preview strip under it, the clock in the column's header, the notes textarea hidden. Each `> note:` paragraph is a card and its bold phrases are the bullets (`cue-cards.mjs`, the grammar the authoring skill documents); a note's position among the chunk's `---` says which beat it belongs to, and `> note: from N` pins one to an advance by number – the escape hatch for a chunk whose beats are a figure's steps, which no separator line can sit between. **A `[Klick: …]` line inside a block is a press too**, and it is the spelling a talk written out word for word arrives in: the stage directions are already in the prose, so the block splits at each one and everything behind it is filed one advance later, which is the arithmetic `from N` does by hand. The words behind the direction's colon title the card it brings up. The list of words that count is fixed – `Klick`, `Click`, and a bare `>` for every language it has no word for – rather than a `STRINGS` entry, because the cards are derived again in this window over a rehearsal override, where the lecture's wording table is not in reach; any other bracketed line (`[Pause.]`) is a stage direction and stays in the card as written – **but never as a card of its own**, because a direction is read, not said, and every card costs a press. A paragraph that is only directions rides the card before it (a pause after words); where no card of the same advance stands before it – the note opens with one, or a click came between – it leads the card after it; one at the head or foot of a paragraph with words is that card's. It is set small, italic and in the soft ink under or above the card's words. Only a note that is a direction and nothing else on its advance still makes a card, marked `stage`. `cueAdvance` in `cue-cards.mjs` is the one test for it, and `lint.js` imports it rather than spelling it a second time (`note-advance-beyond`, for a block that asks for more advances than the slide takes – the surplus cards then stand together on its last beat). The rail lists, for every advance the slide takes, the cards said on it and then the press that leaves it – a reveal with its first words, a figure step with the name the author gave it, a nested beat – and at the end the next slide. That is the order the room experiences it in. The cursor is the red dot, on the card being said. It sits **in front of** the reveal counter: `goForward` asks `viewHooks.consumeForward` first, and a press is spent on the cursor only while another card of the same beat follows it. **On a beat's last card the press goes straight through** to `advanceReveal` – the reveal, the figure step or the next slide happens, and its first card becomes current; it used to move the cursor onto the rail's entry for the click first, which cost a press per beat on which the room saw nothing. `goBack` is the mirror image: back one card while there is one on this beat, and on its first card the press takes the click back and lands on the **last** card of the beat before – so each Backspace undoes exactly one Space. The entry after the cursor, the one the next press brings up, is drawn as `next`. The cursor is local to this window and is never sent – `revealed[chunkId]` stays the only reveal state the two windows share, and the projection never learns the cards exist. `Enter` in this mode goes to the next slide, whatever is left of the cards. `Shift-N` leaves the mode, because the textarea is where notes are typed. Two buttons in the header scale the cards (`--cue-scale`, 0.7–1.8) – no hotkey, for the reason the notes-pane zoom has none. The seam between strip and cards is the same drag handle the other two arrangements carry, and here it sizes both at once: the mirror is a child of the strip, so a wider strip is a bigger projection (`--cue-strip-w`, double-click resets). The mode, the card size and the strip width are remembered globally (`psi-slides:cue-cards`, `psi-slides:cue-scale`, `psi-slides:cue-strip-width`), the cursor is not.
- **The prompter** (`--prompter` only, `docs/history/PLAN-souffleuse.md`): a live prompter that listens to the room and whispers back at most twelve words. Five pieces of chrome, all of them this window's:

  **The strip** `#psiINT-souffleuse-strip` is one element in two homes, exactly like the clock: `position: absolute` over the bottom edge of `#psiINT-stage-cell` in the classic arrangement, and inside `#psiINT-cue-panel` immediately above `#psiINT-cue-rail` in cue-card mode, moved by `cuePlaceStrip` from `applyCueMode`. One line – a glyph for the kind (`◷` time, `◇` example, `△` fact, `◌` delivery, `≫` pace, `⋯` something the notes planned and the talk has walked past, `▤` a card laid into a slide still to come), the words, and a `×`. `high` severity is set in red like `#psiINT-center-toast.warn`, `low` in ink on a `--rule` border. It fades by itself after 15 s, 25 s for a `high` one, and that counts as a dismissal (`how: 'fade'`). Switching the prompter off is not one: the strip and both of its timers go with the switch, and no `souffleuse-dismiss` is sent – there is nobody listening for it, and a hint that faded fifteen seconds after the ear had closed used to send one anyway. The sidecar's policy hears that the hint left the screen from the next `hello` instead. Deliberately not `#psiINT-center-toast`: that lies over the stage, is built for 1.8 s, and cannot be sent away. One consequence of the second home worth keeping: `#psiINT-cue-rail` is `position: relative` under `--prompter`, because `cueRender` scrolls to `curEl.offsetTop` and anything growing above the rail otherwise moved every card by its own height. That rule is in `SOUFFLEUSE_CSS` rather than `SPEAKER_CSS`, and `cuePlaceStrip` wraps `applyCueMode` from `SOUFFLEUSE_JS` rather than being a line inside it: the strip is the only thing that ever grows there, so a cockpit built without the flag has nothing to correct for and carries neither.

  **The switch** is the footer's `◌ prompter` button and `Shift`-`S` (§4.2); `aria-pressed` and the dot's colour say whether it is listening, thinking, or in error. The microphone is the consent, so the button is where it is given – and switching on is what sends the first `souffleuse-hello`.

  **The badge** `#psiINT-souffleuse-badge` is a `.cmd-badge` that appears **only for degraded states**: server speech recognition instead of on-device, a denied microphone, a missing or refused `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, an unreachable OpenRouter. It needs a memory, because a status arrives on every tick: the ear keeps one reason and the sidecar keeps another, and the badge is painted from the pair with server recognition as the quiet thing left underneath. Writing it directly wiped a refused key's reason one message later, at exactly the moment a lecturer looks for it.

  **The history** `#psiINT-souffleuse-log` opens on a **`Shift`-click of the switch** – the last ten things the prompter has said with their time, kind and how each one went away, cards included: a card's row says which slide it was filed into rather than how it was dismissed, because a card is not dismissed. **One row per card, at the time it was laid.** The cards live in this window alone, so a reload – or unticking the cue box and ticking it back – loses them and the sidecar replays them; a replay used to enter the card a second time, stamped with the clock it was replayed on. The card ids already in the record are kept apart from the rows, because the rows are capped at ten. Without them a run that laid four cards and whispered nothing read as a run in which nothing had happened. Plus the two preferences that live in the panel: show what the ear hears, and whether the prompter may lay cards into upcoming slides. No key, because every free letter in this window is a navigation command that would fire mid-sentence and the history is read after a talk or between two slides, never inside one.

  **The line under the strip** `#psiINT-souffleuse-heard` is one element with two roles, and the opening quiet is the switch between them. For the first minute after the switch it shows the last eight or so words the ear has provisionally heard, with no preference touched: that minute is the one in which the prompter cannot say anything at all, so it is the one in which a speaker wonders whether it works. Afterwards the same line carries the heartbeat instead – `listening`, `asking the model…`, `asked 18s ago · 4 so far` – in the mono face and without the italic, because it is chrome and not something anybody said. The correct behaviour of this feature is silence, and silence looks exactly like a prompter that died; the heartbeat is the difference. `#psiINT-souffleuse-heard-toggle` keeps the words up for a whole talk for somebody who wants them.

  A card the prompter lays into an upcoming slide joins that slide's cue list on beat 0 and is drawn by `cueRender` as `.cue-card.souffleuse` – dashed track, `◌`, italic. In the classic arrangement, which has no rail to put it in, the same card is shown once as a strip hint of kind `cue` when the talk arrives at the slide. **Its arrival is acknowledged at once**, wherever the talk is: the strip carries `▤ card for <the slide's cue title>` for six seconds, low, and only when no hint is standing – what stands was judged worth interrupting a sentence for and an acknowledgement is not. It has a `cueId` and no `hintId`, so sending it away stays in this window. Before it, the only sign that the prompter had done anything was a card in a slide the speaker had not walked to yet.
- **Footer**: five buttons – six under `--prompter`, where `◌ prompter` joins them – `● live` / `❄ frozen` (the freeze state *is* the control, = `V`), `⇄ layout` (strip orientation, = `Shift-V`), `▤ cards` (cue cards, = `K`), `export notes` (= `Shift-E`), `? help` (= `?`) – then the lecture slug and a one-line key crib. The freeze state used to be a bare indicator span: a status light with no way to press it is a question with no answer beside it, and it was the one cockpit control with no mouse route at all.

  The floating round `?` button that both live views carry bottom-left is **hidden in the speaker**: the footer already has a labelled `? help`, and the circle sat on top of the timer. Beside it, `audience.html` alone carries a **start menu** (`#psiINT-start-menu`: *Fullscreen W*, *Speaker cockpit S*, *Print view P*, and `‹` to put it away for good; an entry whose file is not beside `audience.html` is left out, and its key shows *speaker.html is not beside this file* (or *print.html …*) in the mode badge instead – see *A view that is not there* below), shown only before the talk starts – on the first slide of a page load that opened there, outside fullscreen, until the first move from either window. The cockpit never has it, and so a move made here ends it on the projection. Folded – by a move, `W`, fullscreen or `‹` – it leaves a `›` (`#psiINT-start-menu-show`) beside the `?` circle, which stands and hides where the circle does (not in the overview, not on a blanked projection) and so stays mid-talk as quietly as the circle. A click on it opens the menu on whatever slide is up, on demand, and removes the stored `away`, so the next page load on slide 1 opens with the menu again; the menu it opened folds on the same triggers as before the talk – the next move from either window, `W`, fullscreen or `‹`. Neither the menu nor the `›` is drawn where a probe set `PSI_NO_START_MENU` (`--frames`, `--check-fit`, `--squint`), and the site's shot rigs hide both.

**A view that is not there.** Two answers, the build's and the page's. The build decides once (`siblingViewsAbsent`: neither written by this build nor already in the output folder) and writes `window.PSI_ABSENT_VIEWS` only when something is missing; the start menu is then rendered with the entry hidden. That misses the view that was there at build time and is gone now – `audience.html` mailed on alone, or copied out of its folder – so the page also asks at run time (`probeView` in `AUDIENCE_JS`). **The page's answer wins**: the build's list is a hint, because a later partial build can put the view beside an `audience.html` it does not rewrite (`--audience-only`, then `--speaker-only`, then `--print-only` into an empty folder), so the probe runs whatever the list says and a view it finds is offered and opened. The list decides only where the page cannot ask – no `file:` or `http(s):` address, a `HEAD` that fails on the network, a probe with no answer in three seconds. Under `--serve` that means a deck built alone puts a 404 for each missing view on the console when the menu is shown or the key pressed. Under http(s), as under `--serve`, it is a `HEAD` request (404 or 410 means missing; any other status means there, and a network failure is left to the build's list). From `file://` no request can read a file – `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` are refused for the `null` origin, and an `<iframe>` fires `load` either way and cannot be read – but a `<script>` element can try to load one, and its `load` and `error` events tell the two apart. Measured on 2 October 2026 with a page beside a real `print.html` and a missing name, eight mechanisms, one engine each: Chrome 154, Firefox 156 (headless) and Safari 26.6 all gave `load` for the file that is there and `error` for the one that is not, within 10 ms; `<link rel=stylesheet>` and `<link rel=preload as=fetch>` did too, but preload warns on the console in Chrome, and `<object>` and `<iframe>` timed out for a missing file in Safari or Firefox. Nothing in the file runs: a view starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, which is a syntax error before the first statement, and while the probe stands a capturing `error` listener calls `preventDefault()` on that one error, so it does not reach the console in any of the three. A missing file does put the browser's own *not found* line there, which is the one case it is news. The probe runs on a press of `S` or `P` (and their palette rows) and when the start menu is shown – never on a page load the menu does not stand on. The answer is kept: when the view was found before, the press opens its window at once, inside the key's gesture, and re-asks in the background; otherwise the window opens when the probe answers, a few milliseconds later, still well within the browsers' transient activation. `test/palette.mjs` builds a full deck, deletes `print.html` and opens `audience.html` from `file://`: the menu drops *Print view*, `P` and the palette row show the notice, nothing opens, and `S` still opens the cockpit.

### 4.1a Help overlay

Both live views ship a full-screen keyboard-and-mouse reference on `?` (or the small `?` button in the corner / footer). It is grouped **by task, not by key**, and lists mouse gestures next to keys: several of the most useful affordances (resize the notes pane, click a figure to zoom it, drag to pan the overview board) have no key at all and were previously undiscoverable. `Esc` closes it ahead of every other Esc target; clicking the scrim closes, clicking inside does not, so the panel can stay open while you try a key.

**A search field heads the panel** and has the focus when it opens (except on a touchscreen, where a focused field puts a keyboard over the panel). Typing filters the rows: every word of the query has to be in a row – its key column, its description or its section title, case and diacritics folded – and a single character matches keys only, so `b` finds the `B` row and not every row with a b in it. While the field has the focus the key map stands aside (the listener's input guard), so a letter typed there is a letter. `Esc` empties a field with text in it and closes the panel from an empty one; `?` in an empty field closes it too. The placeholder and the line shown when nothing matches follow `lang:` (`help-search`, `help-none` in `STRINGS`); the rows are English. The panel opens unfiltered every time.

**The panel is also a command palette.** `Cmd`-`K` / `Ctrl`-`K` opens it with the field focused (on a touchscreen too) and closes it again from the field; in any other text field the chord is that field's. It is answered at the head of the keydown listener, ahead of the guard that hands every other Cmd and Ctrl chord to the browser. A row whose command the panel may run (`runsFromPanel` in `commands.mjs`: every command but `?`) and that this view has a run function for is runnable: a query selects its first runnable row, `↑` `↓` move the selection through the rows still standing, `PageUp` `PageDown` by what the panel shows at once, and `Enter` or a click runs it – the panel closes and `COMMAND_RUN[id]` runs with an event shaped like the command's first key, exactly as the key would. In the cockpit a command the projection carries out goes the cockpit's way: `W` from a row arms the projection, `B` sends `blank`. Doc rows – gestures, keys a guard answers, `?` itself – are never selected, and **they stand after every runnable row**: the panel is one column, the runnable rows first, section by section, then the doc rows under a line of their own (*For reference – the mouse, and keys that answer in one place*), muted, in the same sections; a filter keeps that split, best match first within each half. So `↓` always lands on the row right under the selection, and the selection is scrolled into view (with its section's heading when it is the section's first row). The arrows stop at either end rather than wrap. The panel is one fixed box (`min(880px, 95vw)` wide, `min(860px, 95vh)` high), with the rows scrolling inside it, so typing changes only what is in it; every key column is the same width, so the descriptions stand on one left edge. The two-column layout it replaced made `↓` from the left column land on a row of the right one, and skipped the doc rows between two commands. The `Esc` order is unchanged.

**Every key the key map answers has a row**, because both come from one table: `commands.mjs`, where one entry is one row, and an entry with `keys` is also what the key map dispatches (§4.2). `test/gates/commands.mjs` holds the rest – it reads the guards that still answer keys in code (the overview board, the search field, Alt) and fails on a key with no row, unless the key is on its reviewed `NOT_A_ROW` list with a reason (`=` and `_` as spellings of `+` and `-`, and the audience's `K`, which it spends on nothing).

The speaker's copy leads with “Arranging this window”, “Notes”, and “The projector”; the audience's copy omits those and adds `S`, and `N` and `Shift-E` for its own annotations; the cockpit's lists `Shift-W` beside `W`. Rendered by `renderHelpOverlay(view)` in build.js from `helpGroups(view)` in `commands.mjs`, so a label change lands in both.

### 4.2 Keyboard (speaker)

Speaker inherits audience nav bindings, plus:

**One table binds every key in both views.** `commands.mjs` names each command (`id`), its keys and the views that answer it, and it reaches both pages as `window.PSI_COMMANDS`. The keydown listener in `AUDIENCE_JS` first answers `Cmd`-`K` / `Ctrl`-`K` (the palette, §4.1a), then applies its guards – a text field, the `?` panel's search, the search box, the link mark, any Cmd/Ctrl/Alt chord, the go-to prompt, the overview board's arrows – then looks the press up (`commandFor(keyMap(VIEW), e)`) and runs `COMMAND_RUN[id]`. The cockpit's own commands (`V`, `Shift`-`V`, `Shift`-`N`, `Shift`-`W`, `K`, its `Shift`-`E`) are assigned into `COMMAND_RUN` by `SPEAKER_JS`, and `Shift`-`S` by `SOUFFLEUSE_JS`, the way both set `viewHooks`. A shifted press with no binding of its own means what the plain key means, so `Shift`-`B` blanks as it always did. The diagram editor keeps its own map in `editor.mjs`; it runs in capture ahead of this one.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `←` `→` `↑` `↓` | Same as audience (nav broadcasts unless frozen) |
| `Shift`-`←` `Shift`-`→` | Previous / next column, from any chunk (broadcasts) |
| `Space` | Advance reveal (broadcasts) – in cue-card mode, the next card first (local), then the reveal |
| `K` | Cue cards on / off (**local**, remembered) |
| `Enter` | Forward, like Space – except in cue-card mode, where it is the next slide (broadcasts) |
| `1`-`9`, `Esc` | Local to speaker, never broadcast (expansions are audience-only) |
| `N` | Opens the audience-visible annotation on the current chunk, as on the audience: the box fills the stage while typing, the room reads along. `Shift`-`N` is the private notes pane |
| `C` | Cycle collapse (broadcasts) |
| `+` `-` `0` | Zoom (broadcasts) |
| `B` · `.` | Blank – broadcasts **ungated**, so it lands while frozen too. `.` is the key many presenter remotes send for a black screen |
| `M` | The `+ note` button in the slide's left gutter, shown ↔ hidden. Broadcasts **ungated** as its own message (§2), because the button is on the projection and the key is pressed here. `N` still opens an annotation either way |
| `W` | **Fullscreen on the projection** – the slide with nothing of the browser round it. Ungated, like `B` (§2), and it is the one command the projection cannot simply obey: a browser grants `requestFullscreen` only to a gesture in the window that makes the call, so the cockpit's `W` *arms* it and the projection puts up a line to click once (or takes `W` on its own keyboard). Leaving needs no gesture, so a second `W` here takes it straight back out. `Shift`-`W` fills **this** window instead, which is for the one-screen case |
| `D` | **Live demo** – picks a window or a screen of this machine and puts it on the projection; `D` again ends it. Ungated, like `B` (§2). The first capture on a Mac fails while macOS asks for screen-recording rights; the second works |
| `P` | Open print.html in new tab |
| `V` | **Freeze / thaw the projection.** Thawing resyncs the room to the speaker |
| `Shift`-`E` | **Export annotation drafts**: copy every live `annotations[id]` as a marker-wrapped `> annot:` block to the clipboard, then ask before clearing the drafts from localStorage. A declined confirm or blocked clipboard leaves drafts untouched, so the raw notes can always be rescued on a second try. The pasted block is consumed by `node build.js <source.md> --integrate-annotations`, which moves each `> annot:` under its chunk and removes the marker block. |
| `Shift`-`S` | **The live prompter on or off** (`--prompter` only) – the same switch as the footer's `◌ prompter`, and **local**: it starts and stops the microphone in this window and tells the sidecar, and the projection is never told. `Shift` rather than a bare letter for the reason `Shift`-`N` and `Shift`-`V` carry one: a bare `S` fires mid-sentence, and `S` one window over means “open the cockpit”. `SOUFFLEUSE_JS` assigns its run function into `COMMAND_RUN`, so without the flag the key is bound and does nothing. It is in the footer's key crib under the flag, and nowhere without it. Switching on names the language it is about to listen in and where the recognition runs (`prompter listening · Deutsch (de-DE) · on-device`), and the switch's own tooltip keeps saying it after the toast is gone: the tag is the one the availability check settled on, which may carry a region the deck never wrote |
| `?` | Toggle the help overlay (§4.1a) – **local** |
| `Cmd`-`K` / `Ctrl`-`K` | The help overlay as a command palette, field focused (§4.1a) – **local**; a row run from it does what its key does, broadcast or not |
| `Shift`-`V` | Preview strip along the bottom ↔ down the right edge (**local**, persisted). Moved off plain `V`, which now freezes: rearranging this window is the rarer and far less urgent act, and the footer used to label it “preview”, which read as *the preview*, not *where the preview sits* |
| `T` | Toggle a small TOC overlay (**local**, never broadcast) |
| `O` | Toggle overview – **broadcasts**, both windows enter and leave together |
| `G` | **Go to a slide by its number** – the number the corner badge paints (`data-chunk-num`: authored chunks counted through the deck, the auto-inserted dividers left out, the same count the printed document and the cockpit's list use). Digits type into `#psiINT-goto-prompt`, `Backspace` edits, `Enter` lands, `Esc` cancels; a number past the end is refused in place and the prompt stays open with the digits in it. The prompt is **local** and typing into it is never sent, but the landing is an ordinary `jumpTo`, so it **broadcasts** like any other move and the projection follows. Every key is spent inside the prompt while it is open, or `Space` would advance and `N` would open an annotation; an annotation textarea and the search box keep their own keys, so `G` typed into either is a character |
| `/` | Fulltext search inside overview (**local**: the filter highlight is not synced, only the selection it commits to) |

**Where the prompter sits in the `Esc` chain.** `Esc` unwinds one thing per press, in the order the things are in the way. The help panel goes first because it lies in front of everything and was opened deliberately; the address overlay next, because it covers both screens and the room would otherwise be left staring at a URL. Then comes `viewHooks.escapePrompter`: the prompter's history panel if that is open, otherwise the whisper standing on the strip. It is ahead of a live text selection – a hint arrived uninvited and is in the way of nothing, while a highlight is something the lecturer made on purpose – and it returns whether it took anything back, so the chain carries on to the selection, the focused figure, the TOC, overview and the rest when it did not.

### 4.3 Audience → speaker startup

On `S` in audience:
1. If the audience already holds a live cockpit, `S` focuses it and stops here. Otherwise it runs `window.open('', 'psi-slides-speaker', 'width=1400,height=900')`, which finds a cockpit window of that name without navigating it, sends the window to `speaker.html` only when it is not already this deck's cockpit (a fresh blank one, or under `--serve` another page), and stashes the reference as its `peer`. Opening with the URL directly, as up to 2.0.0, re-navigated an open cockpit on every second `S`: a reload that dropped its freeze, its clock and its cue cursor. From `file://` the found window's address cannot be read – every file is an origin of its own – and that used to be taken as proof it was this deck's cockpit; on a tab that had gone from one deck's projection to another's it was the first deck's, and the second drove it. So an unreadable window is asked (`whois`), and only an `iam` naming this deck within `COCKPIT_ASK_MS` (250 ms) keeps it as it is; another deck, or silence (a page of no cockpit, or of a build before this), and it is sent to this deck's `speaker.html`.

**Every message carries the deck** (`deck`, added in `sendToPeer`), and a message naming another deck is dropped before the sender is adopted as the peer. The deck is the folder the view was loaded from, hashed (`DECK_ID`): the two views of a deck always stand side by side and two decks never share a folder, which the title cannot promise; hashed, so the path on disk is not what travels. The opener relationship alone cannot tell two decks apart, because a tab that went from one deck to another is still the opener of the first deck's cockpit. A message without the field is from an older build and is taken, so `--audience-only` beside an older cockpit still pairs.
2. Speaker boots, picks up `window.opener` as its `peer`, posts a `hello` to it.
3. Audience receives `hello`, replies with current state via `peer.postMessage(...)`.
4. Speaker applies state, shows itself ready.

If speaker opens standalone (URL typed directly, bookmark) there is no `window.opener` and the speaker has no peer; it boots from localStorage and runs disconnected until an audience appears. Live cross-window discovery for the standalone case is not in this slice.

## 5. Persistence

Key: `psi-slides:<title>:speaker`. Written every 5 s on change. Same schema as the snapshot payload, plus `elapsedSeconds`. On speaker reload, this is applied locally and then broadcast so the audience catches up if it also restarted.

Annotations use the existing `psi-slides:<title>:annotations` key – already wired in audience. Speaker writes to the same key.

The position both windows boot onto is `psi-slides:<title>:activeIdx`, one key for the two of them, written on every slide change – except by a frozen cockpit, whose slide is not the room's (§2).

**The prompter's six keys, and why four of them are sessions.** `sessionStorage psi-slides:souffleuse` = `on` remembers that the prompter is listening, and it is deliberately *not* `localStorage`: a microphone is an act of consent, the switch is where it is given, and the answer should last as long as this tab and no longer. It exists at all because `--watch` reloads the page on every save, and a rehearsal should not have to press the switch again for each of them – on such a reload the cockpit waits for the socket and starts again by itself, and if the browser refuses recognition without a gesture the badge says so and the switch stays off. The two preferences are the other way round, because how someone likes to rehearse is a property of them and not of a tab: `localStorage psi-slides:souffleuse-heard` (show what the ear hears) and `psi-slides:souffleuse-cues` (may it lay cards into upcoming slides). The deck's `prompter: {cues: off}` is a **ceiling** on the second, not a default – a lecture that switched cards off does not get them because a browser preference says otherwise. Neither the hints, the history panel's list of ten nor the cards laid into upcoming slides are persisted: they are a record of this talk, and the next run of it is a different talk.

The other three sessions are the prompter's own. `sessionStorage psi-slides:souffleuse-clock` holds `tStart`, the origin `elapsedSeconds()` and `souffClock()` count from, written whenever the consent is written and again after a click on `#psiINT-clock`, and read back on load **only** when the consent is there and the value is neither in the future nor more than twelve hours old. Without it a `--watch` rebuild put the talk back to 0:00 in the middle of a rehearsal and the sidecar believed it: the drift went wildly negative, the last tick was stamped in the sidecar's own future so no slide tick could fire again, and the opening quiet minute was stamped afresh on every save. It is tied to the consent rather than kept for every cockpit because a cockpit opened while the room fills is *meant* to start at 0:00, and the clock button is how a speaker says the talk has begun. `sessionStorage psi-slides:souffleuse-onat` holds the moment the switch was thrown on that same clock, written beside it and read back **only** on the restore path: the opening quiet is measured from the press, and re-stamping it on every reload showed the heard-words line for another minute and told the speaker the prompter could not help yet through a minute in which it could – while the sidecar, which keeps its own stamp and rebases it, correctly did not re-quiet. A stored value in the new clock's future is a clock somebody restarted, and then the minute is owed again. `sessionStorage psi-slides:souffleuse-told` remembers that the long form of the switch-on toast – the one naming where the words go – has been said once in this tab.

### 5.1 Source ↔ draft precedence for annotations

Chunks can carry a source-authored annotation via `> annot:` blockquotes (see PRD §3). That text is baked into the audience textarea as its `defaultValue` at build time. At runtime:

- If `annotations[id]` exists in the map (i.e. someone typed live and the keystroke landed in localStorage), that draft wins – even if it is an empty string (the lecturer deliberately cleared).
- Otherwise the textarea shows the source default, nothing is written to localStorage.
- `Shift`-`E` on the speaker is the one-way export: clipboard copy first, then confirm-to-clear. After clearing, the textarea falls back to `defaultValue`, so once the exported snippet is pasted back into `source.md` and the lecture is rebuilt, the source value is again authoritative.

## 6. Build pipeline changes

- Default CLI emits `audience.html`, `print.html`, **and** `speaker.html` into the lecture directory.
- New flag `--speaker-only`. Existing `--audience-only` / `--print-only` stay; only one `--*-only` flag at a time.
- `renderSpeaker(lecture)` reuses `renderAudienceChunk` for the current-chunk panel and for the mini previews (at `--speaker-mini-scale`). Notes pane pulls `> note:` lines; the parser currently strips them – change the parser to collect them into `chunk.speakerNotes: string[]` and then strip from the body. Audience/print behavior unchanged (they ignore `speakerNotes`).

## 7. Locked-in decisions

All confirmed before implementation starts:

- Protocol: **full-state snapshot** per change (§3).
- Annotations: **live sync** on every keystroke, gated by freeze. The typed annotation's layout (type size, block width, QR code) is computed from the text in each window – `fitAnnotation` in `AUDIENCE_JS` – so the two never disagree and the snapshot carries no field for it.
- Current-chunk panel: **interactive** – chevron-clicks open expansions and sync to audience.
- Notes pane: **multi-line Markdown**. Parser collects consecutive `> note:` blockquote lines into `chunk.speakerNotes: string[]`, rendered with `marked`.
- Projection default: **live** (not frozen). `V` toggles.
- Scrubber position: **top strip**.
- Reload behavior: **audience-first**. Speaker `hello`-pings on boot; if reply within ~500 ms, apply that state. Otherwise fall back to localStorage.

## 8. Implementation order

1. Parser: add `chunk.speakerNotes: string[]`; audience/print behavior unchanged (they never read it).
2. `renderSpeaker(lecture)` + SPEAKER_CSS + SPEAKER_JS: static layout first, no sync. Just renders correctly with dummy local state.
3. `window.postMessage` wiring on **both** outputs (peer adoption from inbound messages; audience stashes the spawn return value, speaker uses `window.opener`). Audience sends state; speaker receives + applies. Hello/reply handshake.
4. Speaker → audience direction. Freeze toggle (originally a push toggle plus a `.` force-push; see §2).
5. Timer + crash-recovery localStorage.
6. Smoke test: open both tabs, nav in audience, verify speaker mirrors. Nav in speaker, verify audience mirrors. Freeze, verify the room holds while the speaker moves; thaw, verify the room catches up; `B` while frozen, verify the projection still blanks. With a diagram on screen: edit it in the cockpit and verify the projection follows, freeze and edit and verify it does not, thaw and verify it catches up.
7. Commit.
