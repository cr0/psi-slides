/*
 * tails.mjs – the `{…}` tail grammar and the `::: draw` opener, once.
 *
 * Every attribute tail in the source format is read here: the one on a
 * heading (`## type: Heading {.wide .bare #id}`) and the one on the six
 * slot directives (`::: cards 3 {.outline .middle}`, `::: rows`, `::: side`,
 * `::: overlay`, `::: backdrop`, `::: dock`). One sigil rule for all of them: `.word` is
 * a setting, `#word` an id, and a token that is neither is refused rather
 * than dropped. The `::: draw` opener is the one block line that carries
 * values rather than sigils, and it therefore has no braces at all:
 *
 *   ::: draw [WxH] [autoplay N [cycle]]
 *
 * build.js and lint.js both import this file. That is the second documented
 * exception to lint.js's no-imports rule (the diagram vocabulary is the
 * first), and it is allowed for the same reason: zero dependencies, zero
 * Node APIs, tables plus small pure helpers, and nothing pulled in behind it.
 * Before it existed the grammar was implemented four times - two parsers per
 * file - and every slot table was declared twice with a "mirrors build.js"
 * comment on the lint side.
 *
 * This file must not import diagram-core.mjs, and diagram-core.mjs must not
 * import it: the compiler runs in the browser and knows nothing about
 * playback, and the two words the host owns (`autoplay`, `cycle`) live here
 * alone.

// ── slot tables ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A slot has a *default* and a list of *writable words*, and the two are
// separate fields: on a directive the default may be written (`::: side
// {.top}` is legal and changes nothing), while on a chunk heading a flag's
// default has no spelling - there is no `.shown` to undo `.bare`. The parser
// accepts only `words`; `default` is what the slot resolves to when nothing
// is written.

// The other family in a chunk tail: a class that answers a `style:` key for
// one chunk. Each is spelled `<key>-<value>` so an author who knows
// `style: {wrap: none}` can guess `.wrap-none`, and one who meets
// `.blocks-left` in a source can guess the key. Only two keys, deliberately:
// the two whose right answer changes from slide to slide. Both directions of
// both, because under a deck-wide `wrap: none` the only way left to ask for
// balancing is to ask for it on the chunk.
export const CHUNK_STYLE_CLASSES = {

  'wrap-none':     ['wrap', 'none'],
  'blocks-center': ['blocks', 'center'],
  'blocks-left':   ['blocks', 'left'],
};

// The third key, and the one whose value is a number rather than a word.
// `style: {figure-type: N}` is deck-wide, and the complaint it answers is not:
// a drawing 66 labels wide pulls its own slide's type down to meet it, and
// pulling it back up with the key takes every other figure in the deck with
// it - so a keynote with one dense figure and one sparse one cannot fix
// either. Per chunk it is a bounded set of steps rather than a free number,
// because a class is a word: eleven of them, the key's own 0.6-1.6 range in
// steps of 0.1, spelled as PER CENT so the class reads as a proportion and
// carries no dot (`.figure-type-70` is `figure-type: 0.7`). Ten per cent is
// the smallest step worth a slide - under it nothing in the room moves.
//
// Unlike the four above it, this one does not reach print: neither does the
// key. A document sizes a figure with --dg-fig-size, which is a decision
// about apparatus inside a column of prose and not about a room.
