/**
 * Where the browser is. One function, one file, because it had two homes and
 * a third was about to open.
 *
 * `docs/site/shoot-lib.mjs` and `test/harness.mjs` each carried a byte-identical
 * copy, with a comment in the second asking the reader to keep them in step.
 * That works until it does not: the search changed once, when a Linux runner
 * was added, and the only reason both copies changed together is that one
 * person did it in one sitting. `pdf-export.mjs` would have been the third,
 * and the third is the one where they come apart.
 *
 * Zero dependencies and zero project imports on purpose. It resolves a path;
 * it does not launch anything, so a caller that wants headless, a viewport or
 * a context still says so itself.
