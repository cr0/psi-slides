// Read editor.md first – this file is the *what*, that file is the why. The

// relational language, and this is the graphical way to edit it. It parses
// the block, records where every token sits, answers a drag by rewriting the
// smallest span it can, and re-runs the same compiler the build runs.
//
// **It edits source text, not a model.** There is no second representation to
// drift, no export step that flattens relations into numbers, and no file the
// editor owns. Everything it produces is a block a human could have typed.
//
// Shipped as text, like AUDIENCE_JS – but read from disk rather than embedded
// in a template literal, which is why a backtick in here is safe and a
// backtick in AUDIENCE_JS is a parse error. Same for the regexes: `\s` means

// ── vocabulary, as the sidebar shows it ─────────────────────────────
// The class vocabulary is a closed enumeration and the editor exposes
// exactly those names and nothing else – no freehand, no arbitrary colours,
// no free font choice. Grouped by the slot each occupies, because that is
// what the swatch row *is*: one choice per slot, and picking one displaces
// whatever was there.

// A slot is offered to a set of kinds; a single *option* inside one is
// sometimes narrower than its slot. Both answer the same question – would
// clicking this produce anything but the compiler's refusal – and the answer
// is now literally read off the compiler's own rules rather than restated as a
// list of names.
//
// `DG_CLASS_KINDS` is the compiler's single table of which class is legal on
// which kind, so every `kinds:` field here is derived from it rather than
// hand-kept. Sixteen such lists used to sit in DGE_SLOTS, and the drift was
// not hypothetical in either direction: `.turn` was offered on a box and a
// free text although the compiler accepts it on all six kinds, `fill` was
// missing `edge` so an edge label's ground could be written by hand and never
// unset in the panel, and six rows said `kinds: null` – every kind – which
// shows a swatch for `.emph` on an image, where nothing paints it. A class the
// panel does not offer for a kind cannot be taken *off* there either, because
// dgePlanTail rebuilds a tail from the model and writes back every slot it is
// not touching. Deriving the field makes a dead swatch impossible rather than
// a thing to notice.
//
// The arrowheads row is the one that needs a translation: at beat 0 its
// options are the arrow *tokens*, and each token seeds one of the three head
// classes, so the question "which kinds may carry `<->`" is the question
// "which kinds may carry `.both-heads`".

// ── neighbour guides (editor.md §9.2) ───────────────────────────────
// Snapping in a drawing tool aligns pixels. Here it does something better,
// because **every snap target corresponds to a statement the grammar can
// write** – so a guide is drawn if, and only if, the editor can name the
// line it would produce. A guide the author cannot connect to a line of
// source is decoration, and in this grammar the relation is the whole point.
//
// Four of them, in the order §9.2 ranks them:
//
//   another element's centre or edge line  ->  at m0.cx,…   a ref coordinate
//   the same gap a sibling already has     ->  that number, exactly
//   the line joining two elements          ->  between a,b, and along it frac
//   equal spacing across three or more     ->  spread x | spread y
//
// The first is the row §9.2 calls the one that matters most: **nobody types
// `at c1.cx,m0.cy` from a standing start**, so the guide is not decoration on
// top of that construct, it is the only interface it has.
//
// All four hold to the same rule as the rest of the editor: the snap has to
// survive as a *relation*, never as the number it happens to resolve to
// today. Landing on m0's centre line writes `at m0.cx`, and the next drag
// rewrites the nudge beside it (§9.3) rather than the reference.

// How close a drag has to come, in cells, before a neighbour guide claims
// it. Wider than DGE_ALIGN_TOL, and deliberately: that one aims at the three
// edges of the one element the placement already names, with the pointer
// sitting on top of them. These aim at every line in the figure, from across
// the drawing.
const DGE_GUIDE_CELL = 0.12;
// Equal spacing is held to a third of that, because it is the one candidate
// that writes a *statement* rather than a token: a `spread` makes the element
// a follower, and the strain guide is what the next drag on it will meet.
// That has to be aimed at, not stumbled into – the same bar the docking chips
// clear by making the release itself the commitment.
const DGE_SPREAD_CELL = 0.04;
// An axis this drag has barely touched is not part of it. Without the dead
// zone a pure vertical drag rewrites the x coordinate too, because the
// element happened to be standing on somebody's centre line all along – a
// relation written for a line nobody was aiming at.
const DGE_GUIDE_DEAD = 0.02;
// How far along a joining line a `between` will admit. An element dropped on
// top of one of the two ends is not halfway between them, and
// `between a,b frac 0.02` is a worse way of writing `at a.cx,a.cy`.
const DGE_FRAC_MIN = 0.15;

// Priority, and the reason for it. **A guide is ranked by how much of the
// drag it explains, then by how little source it rewrites.** The winner is
// applied first and claims the axes it moves; anything below it that would
// move a claimed axis is dropped. So two candidates can never argue over one
// pointer position, and two that move different axes can both act – which is
// exactly how `at c1.cx,m0.cy`, two elements and one statement, comes about.
//
//   1  at A.p,B.q   both axes, one token each – §9.2's row that matters most
//   2  between a,b  both axes, one expression
//   3  at A.p,<n>   one axis, and the other stays a bare number
//   4  gap 0.62     one axis, and a number another statement already carries
//   5  spread x     one axis, and a new statement to hold it
//   6  flush middle the word for a relation's cross-axis edge     (already here)
//   7  the 0.05 cell grid                                         (already here)
//
// Ranks 1 and 3 are the same family split by how much of the drag they
// answer, and that split settles the one genuine argument: a ref coordinate
// on both axes is a complete answer and `between` is not better than it,
// while a ref coordinate on one axis leaves the other a bare number – and
// `between`, which names two elements and fixes both, is. A ref coordinate
// beats the grid outright: a number that happens to be round says nothing

// grammar can name what it would write. Two things it can, and they are not
// the same kind of thing, which is why the two handles get different offers.
//
// **An edge handle proposes a number, never `same as`.** `same as X` copies
// *both* dimensions, so offering it from a width-only drag would change the
// height as well – a semantic jump the author did not ask for – and the
// grammar has no "w equals X's w" relation to offer instead. So the edge
// handle offers the number a sibling already carries, exactly the shape the
// sibling-gap guide has, and marks it on the sibling that carries it.
//
// **`same as X` is the corner handle's, and only when both dimensions land on
// one element together.** There it *is* a relation: the box goes on matching
// X when X changes, which is the whole reason the construct exists.
//
// Only numbers the author actually wrote count, for the reason the gap guide
// gives: an unwritten `w` is the label's own measurement, and copying that as
// a literal pins this box to today's typesetting. A `same as` has no such
// problem, because it copies the box rather than a number – so it is offered
// against any element's real geometry.

// a box and the y is a measured drop below another one. That mixture is the
// normal case in a routed diagram, not an edge case.
//
// Where a component holds a reference the drag rewrites its **signed nudge**
// and never the reference. editor.md calls this out as one of the three
// constructs a graphical editor must round-trip: the nudge is one optional
// signed term with no other operators and no nesting precisely so the token to
// replace is always unambiguous. An editor that answered this drag with two
// numbers would turn a diagram that re-routes itself into one that does not.
// A waypoint's own neighbour guides. Same rule as a placement's and the same
// two answers per axis, because it is the same coordinate grammar: a
// component that already holds a reference keeps it and only its nudge moves,
// and a bare number that lands on another element's line becomes `iv.cx`.
// Plot coordinates stay out of it, the way they stay out of the move guides –
// `roc@0.35` names a value in the data, which is a better relation than
// anything a guide can propose about the paper.
//
// A waypoint costs no dependency edge – edges are drawn after every box is
// placed – so there is no cycle to refuse here; dgeGuideHosts is still what
// answers, because a synthetic name from a chart is no more nameable from a
// `via` than it is from an `at`.
// Which halves of one waypoint are written in a plot's own units – the same
// question dgePlotted asks of a placement, and cached the same way, because it
