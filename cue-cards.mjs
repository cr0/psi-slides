/*
 * cue-cards.mjs – a speaker note read as cue cards.
 *
 * One pure function, `notesToCards(text)`, and the two helpers around a time
 * mark. build.js imports it and splices it as text into SPEAKER_JS, the way
 * diagram-core.mjs and the QR encoder travel: one text, two runtimes, so the
 * cards the cockpit derives from a rehearsal override in the textarea are
 * the cards the source would have given – and so the grammar's regexes live
 * here, outside every template literal, where a backslash means what it
 * says. Zero imports, zero Node APIs; test/gates/cue-cards.mjs holds it to
 * this contract without a build.
 *
 * The grammar is small on purpose – it is the subset of Markdown a person
 * writes into a `> note:` block to be read from the corner of an eye:
 *
 *   blank line            ends a card
 *   **bold** / __bold__   one bullet per phrase; the rest of the paragraph is
 *                         dropped, because the bold IS the cue
 *   no bold at all        the whole paragraph, as prose – nothing is lost,
 *                         it is just not a cue yet
 *   - item / 1. item      bullets as written
 *   #### Title            the next card's title (any heading level)
 *   @12:30 / @1:02:30     when this card should be reached, counted from the
 *                         start of the talk; alone on a line it applies to
 *                         the next card, at a paragraph's start to that one
 *   [Klick: …] / [Click:  a press. The card ends here and everything after it
 *   …] / [> …]           is one advance later on the slide's own counter,
 *                         which is what `> note: from N` says by number. The
 *                         words behind the colon title the card that follows,
 *                         unless a heading stands nearer to it.
 *
 * Any other bracketed line - `[Pause.]`, `[Lachen abwarten.]` - is a stage
 * direction, not a press, and stays in the card as the author wrote it. It
 * is not something to say, so it is never a card of its own: a paragraph
 * that is only directions rides the card before it (a pause after words),
 * or, where no card of the same advance stands before it - the note opens
 * with one, or a click came between - the card after it. One standing at
 * the head or the foot of a paragraph rides that paragraph's card. Only a
 * direction with no card to ride at all, in a note that says nothing else
 * on its advance, is still a card, marked `stage`.
 *
 * Inline code, links and emphasis are reduced to their text. Everything
 * returned is plain text; whoever renders it escapes it.
