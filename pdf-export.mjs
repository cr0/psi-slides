/**
 * --slides-pdf, --print-pdf and --print-notes-pdf on the command line: the
 * Playwright driver for pdf-core.mjs.
 *
 * The second documented exception to the single-file build, and the reason is
 * different from diagram-core.mjs's. That one exists because the browser
 * editor has to run the same compiler as Node. This one exists because it
 * imports playwright-core, and build.js must keep building HTML on an install
 * that has no browser binding at all - so build.js reaches it through one
 * `await import()` behind the flag, and nothing here is loaded until an
 * author asks for a PDF.
 *
 * **What the export decides is not here.** Which states become pages, what
 * leaves the clone, what the print DOM is, every diagnostic and the order in
 * which the browser is asked for anything live in pdf-core.mjs, which has no
 * imports and is what the desktop app drives through Electron's own Chromium.
 * This file is the other half: a browser (findChrome, then chromium.launch),
 * the driver contract written in Playwright calls, the file written safely,
 * and the report printed where it has always been printed.

// per page, so each export starts with empty storage - the audience runtime
// restores position, zoom and theme from localStorage on boot.
//
// The routes below are the refusal the export can report; these arguments
// are the floor under them, for what no route sees. A WebSocket opened in a
// Worker passes page.routeWebSocket by, and WebRTC sends STUN over UDP past
// every request layer: a deck script with an RTCPeerConnection reached a
// stun: server during the export. So every connection Chromium makes goes to
// a proxy whose name cannot resolve, loopback included (`<-loopback>` drops
// the implicit bypass, or a worker could still reach a --watch socket), and
// WebRTC may use no UDP that does not go through that proxy - which is none.
