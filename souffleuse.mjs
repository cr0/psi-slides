/*
 * souffleuse.mjs – everything pure about the live prompter.
 *
 * The prompter whispers from the box: at most twelve words, only when the
 * speaker could act on it mid-sentence, and the room notices nothing. The
 * judgement – is that a factual slip? – is the model's. The *restraint* –
 * may a hint come now at all? – is this file, in code, so it is testable
 * without a network and without a browser: test/gates/souffleuse.mjs decides
 * every rule of the policy table in milliseconds.
 *
 * Zero imports and zero Node APIs, like cue-cards.mjs, tails.mjs and
 * diagram-core.mjs. Unlike those three it is not spliced into any page –
 * build.js imports it dynamically under --prompter only, so nothing here
 * has to survive a template literal and nothing here reaches the HTML. It is
 * kept zero-dep anyway, because a gate that needs no `npm install` is the
 * whole reason the fast suite is fast.
 *
 * `notesToCards` is injected rather than imported, the way
 * `createDiagramCompiler({…})` takes its Node leaves: deckPayload reads a
 * `> note:` block as cue cards, and there is exactly one text in this
 * repository that knows that grammar. Importing it would be a second import
 * line in a file whose contract is that it has none; re-implementing it
 * would be a second grammar. So the caller hands it in:
 *
 *   deckPayload(lecture, { notesToCards })
 *
 * Without it the notes still travel, as prose, and carry no `@mm:ss` marks –
 * which is a degradation, not a failure, and the drift arithmetic falls back
 * to the linear estimate `duration:` allows.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and total. Nothing throws on odd input; a function
 * that cannot answer returns the `nothing` shape or null, because the one
 * place this code runs is a live talk and a stack trace helps nobody at the
 * lectern.

// What a hint can be about. `cue` is deliberately not one of them: it is an
// action, not a kind – a card laid into a slide that is still to come.
//
// `pace` is separate from `delivery` because the two are not the same job and
// must not share a cool-down. `delivery` is manner – reading the slide out
// word for word, a question left hanging, an argument that has gone abstract –
// and it is rare by design, three in a talk. Tempo is a condition rather than a moment: it
// lasts minutes, it comes back, and it is the one thing here the code
// measures rather than the model judges (see `speechStats`). One cool-down
// doing both jobs is what crippled the author's first rehearsal.
//
// `skipped` is the speaker's own notes: something this slide planned that has
// not been said and is about to go past.

 *
 * The linear estimate needs twice the slack before it is allowed to speak,

 *
 * `beforeFirst` closes the one branch that would otherwise be a whisper about
 * nothing. A deck whose first `@mm:ss` sits on slide 3 – which is the natural

 * seconds "ahead", and the prompter was then invited to mention a clock
 * nobody had reached. Behind still counts: past the first mark's time
 * and still on the first slide is genuinely late.
 *
 * The thresholds survive `driftSeconds` measuring behind against the next
 * mark: on any one slide the drift still only grows with the clock, so the
 * `grew` test still compares like with like, and it is now zero while the
 * talk is on budget – which is the state in which there was never anything
 * to whisper. What "ahead" means is narrower than it was: not merely that a
