// FILES in scripts/stage-engine.mjs is a hand-written list of the files
// build.js reads about itself, and nothing but this test holds the two
// together. When they disagree the packaged app does not degrade – a
// run-time read that is not staged throws ENOENT inside a renderer, before
// any view reaches disk, so every build in the app fails with a stack trace.
// cue-cards.mjs sat off the list from the day it landed through
// builder-0.1.0 and builder-0.1.1.
//
// Both files are read as text. build.js cannot be imported here: it is the
// engine, it pulls in Shiki and marked, and importing it to learn which
// paths it spells would be a minute of work to answer a question a regex
// answers in a millisecond. stage-engine.mjs cannot be imported either – it
// wipes engine/ and runs npm ci at module scope.
