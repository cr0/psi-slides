// Parity: the app's three PDFs against the command line's, of the same
// source bytes and with the same options. Neither driver's own test can see
// the two drift apart – each is checked against itself – so this is the
// assertion that holds them together: for slides.pdf, print.pdf and
// print-notes.pdf, the same page count and the same `pdftotext` on every
// page, and for the slides also the same chunk and beat on every page, read
// out of the print DOM each driver dumps (the command line's hidden
// --pdf-dump-dom, the app's PSI_PDF_DUMP_DOM in a development run).
//
// No pixel comparison: the two Chromiums differ in glyph antialiasing (Stage
// 0 spike), and a pixel threshold would either miss a layout change or fail
// on hinting.
//
// And one thing more than antialiasing, measured when the tutorial's prose
// pass broke the check: line boxes. Electron 44 (Chromium 152) and
// Playwright's Chromium 153 put the same words on the same lines and still
// measured the tutorial's #arrows 845 and 849 px tall at zoom 0.95, against
// an auto-fit limit of 846 – so the app fitted it at 0.95 and the command
// line at 0.9, and three pages differed. That is not either driver: the fit
// is a threshold on a pixel height, and two engines a few pixels apart
// straddle it whenever a chunk lands that close. Moving the threshold moves
// the straddle and nothing else – re-measured at fill 0.94, 0.945, 0.95,
// 0.955 and 0.96, each one left between one and three of the tutorial's 72
// chunks a step apart. So a page may be a *borderline fit*: the same chunk,
// beat and held-back count, its zoom exactly one fit step (0.05) apart, its
// words the same once the lines are let go of – and the two drivers' own
// measurements saying it was the threshold: at the larger of the two zooms,
// the chunk's flow height fits the limit by at most FIT_TOLERANCE px in the
// driver that took it and overruns it by at most that in the driver that did
// not. pdf-core appends those heights to each dump. Without them a missing
// raster picture, a fallback face or a smaller viewport – a real one-chunk
// regression that also comes out one step apart with the same words – would
// pass as a borderline fit. Everything else stays exact, and the borderline
// pages are named in the log with both heights.
//
// It runs at the end of the smoke test, on the working copy the smoke's
// exports were written into, so it costs one command-line export and no
// second Electron launch. It also runs on its own against a working folder
// the smoke kept:
//
//   PSI_SMOKE_KEEP=1 npm run smoke          # prints the kept folder
//   npm run parity -- <that folder>         (from desktop/)
//
// The command-line half needs the engine's playwright-core, a Chromium and
// poppler's pdftotext. When one is missing it says so and passes, the way
// the repository's other browser checks degrade – except under CI, where a
// check that quietly did not run is a check that was never there.
